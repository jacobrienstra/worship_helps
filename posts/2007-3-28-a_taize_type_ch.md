      Thank you for this wonderful chant.


      Would it be possible for the relevant copyright use information to be
      posted with the online version of it so that when we download the PDF
      version it would have printed on it "Copyright 2006, Clayton J. Schmit.

[![What](/img/what.jpg "What")](/img/shared/what.jpg)Many Christian traditions suffer from a lack of musical resources on the issue of justice.  Here is one based on Micah 6:8 you might try.  It is written in the style of a [Taize](http://taize.fr/en) chant.  In other words, it is a simple line of scripture set to a repeatable refrain.  It can be used in worship on its own as a canticle (scripture set to music), sung as a refrain to prayer petitions, or interspersed with scripture readings.

This Taize type chant was originally composed for use by the worshipping community of Fuller Seminary in Pasadena, California.  Micah 6:8 is the theme verse for the 2006-7 for seminary chapel program.  This song can be used without further permission if the following line of credit is provided:

One of the key features of this type of music is its repeatability.  But, to remain fresh through several repetitions, musicians are encouraged to improvise additional harmonies and to add instrumental obligatos.  These might be written or created ad lib.  Those who desire a written version for flute or violin can obtain one by emailing the composer at cjs@fuller.edu.
