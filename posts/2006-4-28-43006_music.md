Just for fun I thought I'd post a list of music we're using this Sunday with some notes about the choices:

4/30/06 3rd Sunday of Easter  
Scripture readings: Psalm 116 and Colossians 1:15-23 (sermon text)

OPENING HYMN:  
Bb – A Shout Rings Out/Daar juicht een toon (PsH 392)  
    “prelude” choir sings verse 1 in Dutch  
    then with cong 4 verses

OT SCRIPTURE:  
Psalm 116 with “I Love the Lord” (SNC 227)  
(We'll volley back and forth between the reader and the people singing the song.)

PRE-SERMON HYMN:  
The First Place  
(A great song by Matthew Westerholm which fits the sermon scripture like a glove. I created backing vocals for the choir to fill out the refrain a bit.)

COMMUNION:  
D - God So Loved the World (choir only)  
D – At the Name of Jesus/Walker (JN 32)  
D/Eb – Oh Que Bueno (PsH 401)  
    (using clave, maracas and bongos to bring the rhythm to life)  
Eb - Beautiful Savior (JN 5)  
Eb – O Christ, the Great Foundation (SNC 177)  
    (May use the "Let It Rip" arrangement of the tune “Aurelia”)

By way of context, the congregation is Church of the Servant in Grand Rapids. It's a liturgical CRC church with strong ties to Calvin College, Calvin Seminary and the Calvin Institute of Christian Worship. Stylistically, we lean heavily on the Psalter Hymnal and Sing! a New Creation. We also use a good bit of global music, some home grown songs, and dip lightly into choral repertoire and praise and worship.

Peace,

Greg Scheer
