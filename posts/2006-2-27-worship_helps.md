For those Protestant ministers who have congregants that are squeamish about having a cross thumbed on their forehead (“Isn’t that Catholic?”), I’ve found a biblical solution acceptable to all. It isn’t the most edifying passage of scripture, but in

[2 Samuel 13:19](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?book_id=10&chapter=13&verse=18&end_verse=20&version=31&context=context)

a disgraced Tamar puts ashes on her head. Instead of thumbing the cross, try pinching some ash (that’s asH) and sifting it like rubbing two coins together over the head. Now if you want someone to know you’ve been to an Ash Wednesday service you’ll actually have to live it out.
