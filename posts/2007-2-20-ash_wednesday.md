> [![Ash_wednesday](https://worshiphelps.blogs.com/worship_helps/images/ash_wednesday.jpg "Ash_wednesday")](http://worshiphelps.blogs.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/ash_wednesday.jpg) In some monastic communities, monks go up to receive the ashes barefoot.  Going barefoot is a joyous thing.  It is good to feel the floor or the earth under your feet.  It is good when the whole church is silent, filled with the hush of people walking without shoes.  One wonders why we wear such things as shoes anyway.  Prayer is so much more meaningful without them.  It would be good to take them off in church all the time.  But perhaps this might appear quixotic to those who have forgotten such elementary satisfactions.  Someone might catch cold at the mere thought of it.
