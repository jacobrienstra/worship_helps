[![Bkdead_detail](https://worshiphelps.blogs.com/worship_helps/images/bkdead_detail.jpg "Bkdead_detail")](http://worshiphelps.blogs.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/bkdead_detail.jpg) A Book of the Names of the Dead is a very meaningful ritual for All Saints Day. Find a large beautifully bound book with blank pages. Sentences of scripture related to saints and the resurrection might be written in the margins. Or, you can purchase this book from [Liturgy Training Publications](http://www.ltp.org/). A few weeks before All Saints Day, place the book in the church and invite people to write the names of loved ones they wish to remember. Read the names aloud during the distribution of communion at your All Saints Day service. This ritual reminds us that one aspect of the Lord's Supper is the communion with all the saints. When we eat and drink, we dine with our loved ones and all the saints who have gone before us. Instead of reading the names during communion distribution, you could included the names in the prayers or read them at the font in connection with baptismal remembrance.
