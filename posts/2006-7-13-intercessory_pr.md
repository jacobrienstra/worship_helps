[![Prayer2_1](https://worshiphelps.blogs.com/worship_helps/images/prayer2_1.gif "Prayer2_1")](http://worshiphelps.blogs.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/prayer2_1.gif)

In some worshipping traditions, the "prayers of the people" are anything but.  The people don't do much praying at all-- they mostly endure the sincere but longish monologic ramblings of a pastor.  Those congregations who practice a bidding prayer fare a bit better, but their responses ("Hear our prayer, O Lord") can sometimes become dry and rote rather than heartfelt affirmation.  
  
Here is one suggestion for addressing these deficiencies while accomplishing a number of ancillary purposes:

1) increasing congregational participation in the prayers of the people;  
2) letting the prayer's shape be suggested by the prayerbook of God's people -- the Psalms;  
3) making room within the prayer not only for speaking, but for listening to God's voice.

More details after the jump.

At the appropriate point in the service, a leader/liturgist introduces the prayers of the people with words that connect with the theme of the sermon and perhaps the service itself. 

For example, if the service was based on the readings for Proper 7, year B of the Revised Common Lectionary (Jesus stilling the storm and associated texts), the leader might use words like these:

“The scriptures tell us that Christ has the power to calm the storms of our lives, and rescue us in trouble.  In that confidence and hope, let us pray together…”

*   Then the congregation, led by musicians and pehaps a cantor, sings through a short and appropriate ostinato refrain.  For this subject, I might choose _Calm to the Waves_ (Text by Mary Louise Bringle, Tune by Thomas Pavlechko; found in the ELCA's _Renewing Worship_ #263). 
*   The congregation sings the refrain twice. 
*   Then, while the music continues underneath, a second leader/liturgist reads the first three verses of Psalm 107:  “O give thanks to the Lord for he is good; for his steadfast love endures forever.  Let the redeemed of the Lord say so, those he redeemed from trouble and gathered in from the lands, from the east and from the west, from the north and from the south” (NRSV).  
    
*   The first liturgist (or pastor) follows this with extemporaneous prayers of thanksgiving for God’s goodness – especially occasions where God’s power was exercised in love on behalf of those in the congregation, to rescue them from trouble.
*   The congregation sings the refrain again.   
*   A liturgist (perhaps a different one) speaks verses 23-30 of Ps. 107.  These verses should be read very slowly, letting the congregation feel the weight of their lament.
*   The praying liturgist/pastor offers prayers identifying the storms and troubles, and prays specifically for rescue.
*   The congregation sings the refrain again.
*   A third liturgist reads vv. 31-32 of Ps. 107
*   The pastor/liturgist concludes the prayers of the people with thanksgiving – in advance – for God’s healing, love, and compassion.
*   The congregation sings the refrain twice to conclude.
