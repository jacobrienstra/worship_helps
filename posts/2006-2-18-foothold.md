[![Foothold](https://worshiphelps.blogs.com/worship_helps/images/foothold.jpg "Foothold")](http://worshiphelps.blogs.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/foothold.jpg)Someone I know well recently entered -- and won -- a Hymn Search contest held at Fuller Seminary.  One purpose of the song was to commemorate the Fortieth Anniversary of the School of Psychology.   
The other was to articulate something about trust in God for healing.  The author thought Psalm 25 was an excellent expression of this sort of prayer, and so used it as a basis for this text.  It is meant be sung to the tune Kingsfold.  [Here](http://worshiphelps.blogs.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/foothold.jpg) is the text and melody laid out, with chords hand-written above.  This harmonic arrangement of the tune is courtesy of the jazz pianist/preacher [Bill Carter](http://www.presbybop.com).  To get a sense of the arrangement, click [here](http://worshiphelps.blogs.com/worship_helps/music/foothold.mp3) for a down-and-dirty homemade Mp3.
