<li><strong>Remove your phone case and power down your device.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><em>Mighty God, source of power and love, in these moments when my device powers down, I give you thanks for the power you give to me to serve and the energy to live this life.  Remind me to rest when it is time, give me solid sleep.  Help me wake with joy.</em></p>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>Polish with a microfiber cloth.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><em>With this cloth and its small fibers, remind me that each choice I make is like a small fiber, woven into the cloth of my life.  Empower my decisions, Lord; help me to be brave and kind, wise and trustworthy.  Bind all of us and our choices together into a cloth that makes this world safe for everyone.</em></p>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong>Next, reach for a branded disinfecting wipe.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><em>These wipes are full of weird chemicals, O Lord, and I don’t know how this cloth will bio-degrade.  But it is a sign of the wonders of this creation – of materials and inventions, science and industry, and for that I give thanks.  Give wisdom to researchers in all fields and help us protect people, planet, and prosperity for all.</em></p>
<ol start="4">
<li><strong>Let your phone air dry for a minimum of 5 minutes.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><em>Lord, you are more wondrous than wifi – you connect us in ways that we cannot see.  As my phone dries, I pray for all of my contacts in that phone.  Help them to know my affection and respect for them.</em></div><a class="continue" href="/worship_helps/2020/04/coronatide-liturgylitany-for-disinfecting-a-cell-phone.html">Continue reading...</a></article><div class="nav-bottom"><!-- not 0--><a class="previous" href="/worship_helps/post/page/6/">Previous</a></div></div><div class="column col-3-of-3"></div></div></div></body></html>
