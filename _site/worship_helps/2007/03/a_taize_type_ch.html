<p>This Taize type chant was originally composed for use by the worshipping community of Fuller Seminary in Pasadena, California.  Micah 6:8 is the theme verse for the 2006-7 for seminary chapel program.  This song can be used without further permission if the following line of credit is provided:</p>

<p>One of the key features of this type of music is its repeatability.  But, to remain fresh through several repetitions, musicians are encouraged to improvise additional harmonies and to add instrumental obligatos.  These might be written or created ad lib.  Those who desire a written version for flute or violin can obtain one by emailing the composer at cjs@fuller.edu.</p>
