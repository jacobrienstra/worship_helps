<!DOCTYPE html><html><head><title>Worship Helps</title></head><body><header><h1>Worship Helps</h1><h6>A collection of resources and commentary for those who plan and lead weekly Christian worship</h6></header><div class="post-content"><p>In his book on emerging or progressive Christianity, <em>The Heart of Christianity</em>, Marcus Borg questions whether &quot;sin&quot; is the best term for describing our human condition before God. His argument isn't merely theological, but liturgical: &quot;The nearly universal liturgical element of 'confession of sin and absolution' might be replaced or complemented by a 'declaration of what ails us and God's promise to us'&quot; (p. 170). He continues in a note: &quot;I am not suggesting these exact words as 'liturgical headings.' I would hope more elegant phrases could be found, but I am suggesting the notion that lies behind these words&quot; (p. 185, n. 8). Following is one attempt at more elegant phrasing for several of the images Borg mines from the Bible to describe our condition.</p>
<p><strong>Confession of Blindness and Promise of Illumination</strong></p>
<p>God of Light, we confess that our vision is impaired. Your presence is lost to us in the shadows of our world and the darkness of our hearts. We look, yet we do not see, blind to the daily opportunities to praise you and serve others. Restore our sight, we pray, in the name of Christ whose vision of your kingdom come, led him on the path of salvation.</p>
<p><em>God who commanded light to shine out of darkness has sent Christ as the light of the world. He remains with us in the Holy Spirit, and promises that those who seek will surely find. In Jesus Christ, our eyes are open.</em> Amen.</p>
<p><strong>Recognition of Exile and Hope of Restoration</strong></p>
<p>God, alone in whom our hearts find their rest, we have awakened to find ourselves far from home. Our paths have led us away from you. We feel lonely and fear we are abandoned. Here, your word seems foreign to us, and we struggle to sing the songs of heaven. In your faithfulness, show us your presence once again, that we, too, may rejoice with all who call upon your name.</p>
<p><em>We have a good shepherd who searches for lost sheep. The Spirit of God still blows through the wilderness and prays for us. The sacred testimony gives us this hope; God delivers us in Christ</em>. Amen.</p>
<p><strong>Admission of Bondage and Words of Deliverance</strong></p>
<p>Listening God, hear our cries. We are not free. We have enslaved ourselves and others to debt and despair. We are bound by vain desires, and our liberty to love is curtailed by bad habits. Our emotions hold us hostage to wrongs, real and imagined. In our bondage we are less than what you call us to be. Hear and answer us, we pray, in the name of him who came to set prisoners free.</p>
<p><em>The God of the Israelites has shown us the way of exodus. Forsaking what lies behind, we follow our liberating Lord. When we are weak in faith and strength, the Holy Spirit provides daily bread and springs of living water, that we may complete our journey in the land of promise. Thanks be to God.</em> Amen.</p>
