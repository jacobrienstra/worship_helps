This will serve not only to let you know something about me - Andrew Donaldson -- but also to introduce some of the subject areas that I am passionate about.</p>
<p>I am Pastoral Musician and Worship Enlivener (more on that title in a moment) at <a href="http://www.trafalgarchurch.ca/">Trafalgar Presbyterian Church</a> in Oakville, Ontario, Canada. I am currently President of the <a href="http://www.thehymnsociety.org/">Hymn Society in the US and Canada</a>.   And along with my wife, I am part of <a href="http://www.hilariter.ca/index.html">Hilariter</a>, an inter-denominational group of singers and players, based in Toronto, Canada, committed to diversity in worship and to exploring the worship resources available from around the world.</p>
<p>I am a lapsed (and recently re-activated) percussionist with a background in choral music, composition and classical guitar. I'm also a student of the renaissance lute.</p>
<p>An unusual background for a church music director, I'll admit - or at least it was when I began directing church music in the early eighties. At my first congregation, <a href="http://new.beacheschurch.org/">Beaches Presbyterian Church</a> in Toronto, we developed a music program that included &quot;traditional&quot; strophic hymns, world music, and original music written by congregational members, including myself.<a class="continue" href="/worship_helps/2006/01/new_kid_on_the_.html">Continue reading...</a></div><div class="post-footer">Posted at 02:00 PM in <a class="tag-link" href="/worship_helps/music">Music</a><span> | </span><a href="/worship_helps/2006/01/new_kid_on_the_.html"><i class="fas fa-link"></i> Permalink</a></div></article><article class="post-list"><h3 class="post-title"><a href="/worship_helps/2006/01/technology_musi.html">Technology in Worship</a></h3><h5 class="post-date">January 29, 2006</h5><div class="post-content"><p>Last week I finished writing a piece for Fuller Seminary's 3x-yearly magazine of theology &amp; commentary, <a href="http://www.fuller.edu/news/pubs/tnn/2005_fall/index.htm">Theology News &amp; Notes</a>. This particular issue's theme is the place of music in worship, and I was asked to contribute a piece on the effect of technology on worship music. My thesis, simply put, is a truism borrowed from the computer industry -- hardware drives software:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As the church seeks to make the most of certain hardware technology – amplification, lyric projection, and looping DJ software, for example – we can expect that our worship software, i.e. the style of our worship itself, will also change. It may expand in potentially wonderful and creatively enculturated new ways, following the leading of the Holy Spirit. Or it may be narrowed in ways that are hip, but historically, and even theologically, suspect.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The article then examines the three aforementioned technologies, pointing out the good and the bad, the helpful and the heinous.</p>
<p>The idea for the piece arose arose out of a seed of an observation about hardware and software and the composition of some contemporary worship songs:<a class="continue" href="/worship_helps/2006/01/technology_musi.html">Continue reading...</a></div><div class="post-footer">Posted at 10:38 AM in <a class="tag-link" href="/worship_helps/music">Music</a>,&nbsp<a class="tag-link" href="/worship_helps/technology">Technology</a><span> | </span><a href="/worship_helps/2006/01/technology_musi.html"><i class="fas fa-link"></i> Permalink</a></div></article><article class="post-list"><h3 class="post-title"><a href="/worship_helps/2006/02/the_lord_be_wit.html">The Lord Be with You</a></h3><h5 class="post-date">February 08, 2006</h5><div class="post-content"><p><a href="http://worshiphelps.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341c423653ef01b8d21a28be970c-popup"><img src="https://worshiphelps.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341c423653ef01b8d21a28be970c-120wi" alt="TLBWY.opening" title="TLBWY.opening"></a>A few years ago, my worship team tackled the question of how to begin our 'contemporary' worship services.  Sometimes the band would just walk up front and begin to play. Sometimes there'd be a time of teaching new music.   Sometimes there would be a song that felt like a prelude.  Other times there were announcements.</p>
<p>We wanted to create a dramatic launch to the service (&quot;Here we go!&quot;) without succumbing to the cultural forces that pull us toward making the whole thing an entertaining show (&quot;Ladies and Gentlemen!  Your attention please!&quot;)</p>
<p>We decided to begin with an appropriate greeting -- in the Lord's name, if not in the Lord's voice -- and then remind each other of why we've gathered: to worship, to renew the covenant of grace between God and God's people.  What we came up with was a short opening song.  Click <a href="http://worshiphelps.blogs.com/TLBWY.opening.pdf">here</a> for the music in lead sheet format.  And <a href="http://worshiphelps.blogs.com/TLBWY.opening.mp3">here</a> for an Mp3 recording.</p>

Chip Andrus, a pastor, teacher, and musician with the Office of Theology and Worship for the PC(USA) has written a lively folk prayer that works well for just this purpose.</p>
<p>Sing upbeat, but not too fast—maybe 88 bpm. The song is syncopated throughout, but is notated more simply <a href="http://worshiphelps.blogs.com/worship_helps/CometotheTable.pdf">here</a> for easier learning. Once you’re familiar with it as written, attempt appropriate syncopation where you feel it (the third “come” in the first measure should slightly anticipate the third beat). If you have trouble, ask your kids for help. The song repeats the chorus a few times, and then concludes moving to the tonic and repeating “come.”</p>
<p>This wonderfully percussive tune works best antiphonally. When the meal is almost ready, begin to sing (“Come, come, come!”) as you bring the food from the kitchen to the table. Or send out a family member to the corners of the house, singing and summoning everyone together. When all are assembled, conclude with a spoken prayer to God, since this song is a call to pray and feast rather than a prayer itself.</p>
<p>It’s especially fitting to pray following a classic prayer pattern, like a collect. So, for instance, begin by (1) addressing God and naming one of God’s attributes (“God, you are . . .”); then (2) speak a word of thanks and/or make an appeal rooted in that attribute (“we thank you for/help us to . . .”); finally, (3) express an aspiration rooted in God’s character, an outcome that makes sense of the request (“so that we might . . .”). For example, (1) Lord Jesus, you said that wherever two or three are gathered together, you are with them. (2) We thank you, then, for this good food, for those who made it, for each other, and for your presence with us as we eat. Open our eyes to see you at this table, (3) so that we might more easily see you when we leave it.<a class="continue" href="/worship_helps/2006/02/come_to_the_tab.html">Continue reading...</a></div><div class="post-footer">Posted at 25:26 AM in <a class="tag-link" href="/worship_helps/music">Music</a>,&nbsp<a class="tag-link" href="/worship_helps/prayer">Prayer</a><span> | </span><a href="/worship_helps/2006/02/come_to_the_tab.html"><i class="fas fa-link"></i> Permalink</a></div></article><article class="post-list"><h3 class="post-title"><a href="/worship_helps/2006/02/foothold.html">Foothold</a></h3><h5 class="post-date">February 18, 2006</h5><div class="post-content"><p><a href="http://worshiphelps.blogs.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/foothold.jpg"><img src="https://worshiphelps.blogs.com/worship_helps/images/foothold.jpg" alt="Foothold" title="Foothold"></a>Someone I know well recently entered -- and won -- a Hymn Search contest held at Fuller Seminary.  One purpose of the song was to commemorate the Fortieth Anniversary of the School of Psychology. <br>

<p>Then a year and a half ago, a colleague who now serves as mission director for United Methodism's new work in Cameroon emailed and said, in effect, &quot;I need someone to come over here and encourage the young leaders of the church to create their first hymnal/worshipbook.&quot;  Since the first leap had been really energizing, I decided to leap again.</p>
<p>At one level, I was a fool to say yes.  I had no business thinking I could walk into a bi-lingual culture (French/English) with only a few years of high school French and act as an entrepreneur of hope for people who had more music in their index fingers than I had in my whole body.  But sometimes the call to do something comes before you have all the actual equipment to live in that call.</p>
<p>What I'll be doing in this blog is to tell stories about the journey I've had as a baby ethnomusicologist.  I'll report the stumblings and the victories.  I hope what will be most transparent is the degree to which what is happening in Cameroonian Methodism is nothing more or less than the grace of God taking amazing forms.<a class="continue" href="/worship_helps/2006/04/confessions_of_.html">Continue reading...</a></div><div class="post-footer">Posted at 05:25 PM in <a class="tag-link" href="/worship_helps/music">Music</a><span> | </span><a href="/worship_helps/2006/04/confessions_of_.html"><i class="fas fa-link"></i> Permalink</a></div></article><article class="post-list"><h3 class="post-title"><a href="/worship_helps/2006/04/43006_music.html">4/30/06 music</a></h3><h5 class="post-date">April 28, 2006</h5><div class="post-content"><p>Just for fun I thought I'd post a list of music we're using this Sunday with some notes about the choices:</p>

<p>I print out twently-four, 8.5 x 11 sheets that each have an artfully fonted, black and white excerpt from the Psalms or some other praise text.  If the room is large, I print out double-copies.  Before leading, I hang these sheets on the walls of the worship space using scotch tape.  Some I hang low on the wall, some eye-level, and some higher.  Some sheets, I scatter on the floor.  It is best to have the sheets three to five feet apart from each other.</p>

<p>Take Pentecost for example. The story in Acts 2 is rich with allusion, imagery, history, narrative - all of which have filled many books and many sermons. If we frame the reading of the story with a musical response sung by the congregation, we encourage the worshipping community to glimpse more of those layers. More than glimpse: experience.</p>
<p>It is the prophet Joel's story: though he'd lived long before New Testament times, his presence continued to be felt. Repeating the refrain reminds us of the prophetic witness that informs this account of the event.</p>
<p>It is a Jewish story: there were many Jewish renewal movements before, during and after Jesus' time. The events described by Luke took place during Shavu'oth, the harvest festival, with Jewish pilgrims gathered in Jerusalem from all over the known world. The music below is in the form of a hora, a Jewish dance of celebration. Even though the composition is modern - and we of course do not know how the music of the time of Jesus sounded - the music itself can give us a flavour of the times.<a class="continue" href="/worship_helps/2006/05/singing_penteco.html">Continue reading...</a></div><div class="post-footer">Posted at 16:39 PM in <a class="tag-link" href="/worship_helps/music">Music</a><span> | </span><a href="/worship_helps/2006/05/singing_penteco.html"><i class="fas fa-link"></i> Permalink</a></div></article><div class="nav-bottom"><!-- not 0--><a class="next" href="/worship_helps/music/page/2/">Next</a></div></div><div class="column col-3-of-3"><section class="categories"><h4 class="title"> <a href="/worship_helps/archives.html">Categories</a></h4><ul class="container"><li><a class="link" href="/worship_helps/alt/">Alt</a></li><li><a class="link" href="/worship_helps/church_year/">Church Year</a></li><li><a class="link" href="/worship_helps/daily_prayer/">Daily Prayer</a></li><li><a class="link" href="/worship_helps/drama/">Drama</a></li><li><a class="link" href="/worship_helps/lectionary_texts/">Lectionary Texts</a></li><li><a class="link" href="/worship_helps/music/">Music</a></li><li><a class="link" href="/worship_helps/ordo/">Ordo</a></li><li><a class="link" href="/worship_helps/prayer/">Prayer</a></li><li><a class="link" href="/worship_helps/preaching/">Preaching</a></li><li><a class="link" href="/worship_helps/ritual/">Ritual</a></li><li><a class="link" href="/worship_helps/technology/">Technology</a></li><li><a class="link" href="/worship_helps/theme/">Theme</a></li><li><a class="link" href="/worship_helps/visual_art/">Visual Art</a></li><li><a class="link" href="/worship_helps/webtech/">Web/Tech</a></li><li><a class="link" href="/worship_helps/words/">Words</a></li></ul></section><section class="archives"><h4 class="title"> <a href="/worship_helps/archives.html">Archives</a></h4><ul class="container"> <li><a class="link" href="/worship_helps/2020/04/">April 2020</a></li><li><a class="link" href="/worship_helps/2008/06/">June 2008</a></li><li><a class="link" href="/worship_helps/2007/07/">July 2007</a></li><li><a class="link" href="/worship_helps/2007/03/">March 2007</a></li><li><a class="link" href="/worship_helps/2007/02/">February 2007</a></li><li><a class="link" href="/worship_helps/2007/01/">January 2007</a></li><li><a class="link" href="/worship_helps/2006/12/">December 2006</a></li><li><a class="link" href="/worship_helps/2006/11/">November 2006</a></li><li><a class="link" href="/worship_helps/2006/10/">October 2006</a></li><li><a class="link" href="/worship_helps/2006/09/">September 2006</a></li><li><a class="link" href="/worship_helps/2006/08/">August 2006</a></li><li><a class="link" href="/worship_helps/2006/07/">July 2006</a></li><li><a class="link" href="/worship_helps/2006/06/">June 2006</a></li><li><a class="link" href="/worship_helps/2006/05/">May 2006</a></li><li><a class="link" href="/worship_helps/2006/04/">April 2006</a></li><li><a class="link" href="/worship_helps/2006/02/">February 2006</a></li><li><a class="link" href="/worship_helps/2006/01/">January 2006</a></li><li><a class="link" href="/worship_helps/2005/12/">December 2005</a></li></ul></section></div></div></div></body></html>
