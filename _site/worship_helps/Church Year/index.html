If you follow the lectionary readings for this season you will find that they are accounts of prophets proclaiming the coming of God’s kingdom and anticipation of the coming of the messiah. We re-live this anticipation through these texts, our music, and even the way creation enters more deeply into darkness until the passing of the winter solstice.</p>

<p><strong>History and Symbolism</strong></p>
<p>The Advent wreath has its roots in northern European pre-Christian practices where people sought the return of the sun in the darkest time of the year (at the winter solstice) by lighting candles and fires. By the middle ages, Christians used fire and light to represent Christ's coming into the world. Using this same symbolism, the Advent wreath developed a few centuries ago in Germany. The advent wreath signifies waiting and hopeful expectation, looking forward to both Christ’s birth and to Christ’s coming again at the end of time. The circular shape of the wreath represents eternal life. The evergreens signify the faithfulness of God and the lighted candles reminder us of the light of Christ in the world.</p>
<p><strong>Making an Advent Wreath</strong></div><a class="continue" href="/worship_helps/2006/10/advent_wreath.html">Continue reading...</a></article><article class="post-list"><h3 class="post-title"><a href="/worship_helps/2006/12/john_mayer_and_.html">John Mayer and Advent</a></h3><h5 class="post-date">December 04, 2006</h5><div class="post-content"><p>During the season of Advent waiting is a central theme. The community of Jesus’ time was waiting for the promised messiah to come. They were waiting for someone to deliver them from an oppressive political structure. There was unnecessary violence, moral religious laws trumping acts of love and justice and a veiled connection between the politically powerful and the religiously powerful. We know that Jesus was crucified by both the religious majority of his time in cahoots with the political ruler Pontius Pilot. We see politics and religion today being used in ways that go against God’s plan for us and creation. John Mayer in his song “Waiting On the World To Change” expresses frustration about the current situation and hope for something better. He begins by saying:</p>
<p>me and all my friends<br>
we're all misunderstood<br>
they say we stand for nothing and<br>
there's no way we ever could<br>
now we see everything that's going wrong<br>
with the world and those who lead it<br>
we just feel like we don't have the means<br>
to rise above and beat it</p>
<p>so we keep waiting<br>
waiting on the world to change<br>
we keep on waiting<br>
waiting on the world to change</p>

<p>In this season of Advent, this season of waiting, what does this song say about us? John claims that he is not alone in being misunderstood and “waiting for the world to change”. What kind of waiting do people of faith do? What did our ancestors do while waiting for the messiah? Is there such a thing as active waiting? How does “Prepare Ye the Way of the Lord” resonate with John Mayer’s description of how he and all his friends are waiting? John goes on to say in the last verse of his song:</div><a class="continue" href="/worship_helps/2006/12/john_mayer_and_.html">Continue reading...</a></article><div class="nav-bottom"><!-- not 0--></div></div><div class="column col-3-of-3"><section class="categories"><h4 class="title">Categories</h4><a class="link" href="/worship_helps/Alt/">Alt</a><a class="link" href="/worship_helps/Church Year/">Church Year</a><a class="link" href="/worship_helps/Daily Prayer/">Daily Prayer</a><a class="link" href="/worship_helps/Drama/">Drama</a><a class="link" href="/worship_helps/Lectionary Texts/">Lectionary Texts</a><a class="link" href="/worship_helps/Music/">Music</a><a class="link" href="/worship_helps/Ordo/">Ordo</a><a class="link" href="/worship_helps/Prayer/">Prayer</a><a class="link" href="/worship_helps/Preaching/">Preaching</a><a class="link" href="/worship_helps/Ritual/">Ritual</a><a class="link" href="/worship_helps/Technology/">Technology</a><a class="link" href="/worship_helps/Theme/">Theme</a><a class="link" href="/worship_helps/Visual Art/">Visual Art</a><a class="link" href="/worship_helps/Web/Tech/">Web/Tech</a><a class="link" href="/worship_helps/Words/">Words</a></section></div></div></div></body></html>
