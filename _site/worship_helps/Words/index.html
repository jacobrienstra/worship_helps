<p>I print out twently-four, 8.5 x 11 sheets that each have an artfully fonted, black and white excerpt from the Psalms or some other praise text.  If the room is large, I print out double-copies.  Before leading, I hang these sheets on the walls of the worship space using scotch tape.  Some I hang low on the wall, some eye-level, and some higher.  Some sheets, I scatter on the floor.  It is best to have the sheets three to five feet apart from each other.</p>

<p>Typically, as I did early this morning for a Fuller D.Min. class, I begin with one song of declaratory praise, sung together.  After that song is finished, I play quietly as I explain the worship excercise, saying:<a class="continue" href="/worship_helps/2006/04/deck_the_walls_.html">Continue reading...</a></div><div class="post-footer">Posted at 34:19 PM in <a class="tag-link" href="/worship_helps/alt">Alt</a>,&nbsp<a class="tag-link" href="/worship_helps/music">Music</a>,&nbsp<a class="tag-link" href="/worship_helps/words">Words</a><span> | </span><a href="/worship_helps/2006/04/deck_the_walls_.html"><i class="fas fa-link"></i> Permalink</a><span> | </span><a href="/worship_helps/2006/04/deck_the_walls_.html"><i class="fas fa-comment"></i> Comments (2)</a></div></article><article class="post-list"><h3 class="post-title"><a href="/worship_helps/2006/05/easter_alleluia.html">Easter Alleluia</a></h3><h5 class="post-date">May 09, 2006</h5><div class="post-content"><p><a href="http://worshiphelps.blogs.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/butterfly.gif"><img src="/img/butterfly.gif" alt="Butterfly" title="Butterfly"></a> In a class I'm teaching on Crafting Language for Worship, we recently had a discussion about the value of significant words and repeated phrases in worship.  Some of my students from evangelical and free-church traditions reported with delight the value they have discovered in the the persistent Easter season call-and-response &quot;Christ is risen!  Alleluia!/<em>He is risen indeed, Alleluia!&quot;</em> They report that using this refrain now is profoundly formative, reminding them of the catholicity of the church, and connecting them with the faithful of so many times and places.</p>
<p>All of this reminded me of a time when my congregation practiced a fast from the use of the word &quot;Alleluia&quot; throughout the season of Lent in anticipation of its exuberant reintroduction to worship on Easter Sunday.  Throughout the forty days, we still sang songs with &quot;alleluia&quot; in the lyrics, but self-consciously hummed &quot;mm-mm-MM-mm&quot; instead.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the young children of the church spent one of their education hours creating colorful construction paper butterflies, decorated abundantly with the word &quot;Alleluia.&quot;   These were then crafted into a beautiful mobile, which debuted on Easter morning hanging high over the communion table, pointing to new life in Christ.  Alleluia!  He is risen!</p>

While his other sermons are identifiably Pharisaical and present the gospel in a way that would be accessible to a predominantly Jewish audience, the Athenian sermon employs patterns and concepts which were common to first century Athens. It is a significant and noteworthy accomplishment on Paul’s part and it may be taken as a mandate to subsequent Christians always to be prepared to articulate the gospel message using new and distinct cultural patterns. While the content of the Gospel is always consistent, the form in which the good news of Jesus Christ is presented should always be flexible. What follows are excerpts from a somewhat playful worship service that was designed to illustrate to a worshiping community the issues and possibilities involved in attempting to articulate a Christian worship service in a particular context.   College students, youth, and children are often engaged by this way of distinguishing between what is essential and what is negotiable in worship.   Read the liturgy after the jump.</p>

<p>One of the neat features of the service was a skit composed and improvised by seminarians that illustrated the contrast between the flippant way we use the word &quot;blessing&quot; and the powerful way the word is understood in scripture.</p>
<p>They did this by juxtaposing funny 3-4 line sketches with longer scriptural or other readings.  Examples of both after the jump.</p>

He has a PhD on the Emerging Church and a Masters in Theology in communicating the cross in a postmodern world. Steve recently did a course at Fuller Seminary entitled “Communicating the Biblical Text in a PostModern Culture” in July.</p>
<p>He argues that to communicate the biblical text for today’s context requires one to “incarnate, indwell, our culture.”  Taylor goes on to use the phrase “DJing” with respect to the community.  A record DJ learns the historical stories (old records) and uses them authentically in contemporary culture and integrates them into the community's stories.  There is too much to summarize here, but do look for his book “<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0310259045/sr=8-1/qid=1155843286/ref=sr_1_1/002-0739142-4980844?ie=UTF8">The Out of Bounds Church: Learning to Create a Community of Faith in a Culture of Change</a>” from Zondervan.</p>
<p>Taylor cites Bono of U2 as a person who effectively DJs today.  According to Taylor, Bono is in fact a worship leader for over 40,000 people; Bono recontextualizes the biblical text and leads concert goers into a time of community worship and prayer. Taylor plays the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000BNXDE6/sr=8-1/qid=1155843384/ref=pd_bbs_1/002-0739142-4980844?ie=UTF8">“Vertigo ‘05” DVD</a> and shows us how Bono is leading worship.  This intrigued me to the point that  Dr. Taylor and I discussed this further after the workshop. The following is from Steve’s article <a href="mailto:www.emergentkiwi.org.nz/archives/7_things_i_learnt_from_bono_about_worship_leading.php">“7 Things I learnt from Bono about Worship Leading.”</a></p>
<p><strong>1.    Connect uniquely.</strong> In the Vertigo DVD, Bono speaks about Chicago and his memories of Chicago. He makes a unique connection with context, day, and time.<br>
<strong>2.    Engage through familiarity.</strong> Bono includes songs that resonate with previous experiences and previous encounters.<br>
<strong>3.    Use repetition to call forth prayer.</strong> Bono uses the repetitive “Hallelujah.” It is easy to sing. The simple repetition enables the audience to sing with the band.<br>
<strong>4.    Secure a 5th (visual) band member.</strong> U2 now has a 5th member of the band to add a visual layer to the experience. A wise worship leader will look to add not just singers or musicians, but a “visual” person to their team.<br>
<strong>5.    Create hope by drawing the best from the past.</strong> Bono tells the audience in the Vertigo DVD, “We as a band are looking to the future. We’re taking the best of the past and moving forward with hope.”<br>
<strong>6.    Plan participation.</strong> Bono can draw one boy from the audience to sing to, one woman from the audience to dance with. He uses repetition to call forth prayer and encourage congregational singing.<br>
<strong>7.    Invoke passionate practices.</strong> Bono invites the audience to hall out their cell phones and to text “Make Poverty History campaign.”  A worship leader turns singing into action. He turns entertainment into justice.<a class="continue" href="/worship_helps/2006/08/7_worship_leadi.html">Continue reading...</a></div><div class="post-footer">Posted at 46:39 PM in <a class="tag-link" href="/worship_helps/music">Music</a>,&nbsp<a class="tag-link" href="/worship_helps/ordo">Ordo</a>,&nbsp<a class="tag-link" href="/worship_helps/prayer">Prayer</a>,&nbsp<a class="tag-link" href="/worship_helps/preaching">Preaching</a>,&nbsp<a class="tag-link" href="/worship_helps/ritual">Ritual</a>,&nbsp<a class="tag-link" href="/worship_helps/technology">Technology</a>,&nbsp<a class="tag-link" href="/worship_helps/theme">Theme</a>,&nbsp<a class="tag-link" href="/worship_helps/visual_art">Visual Art</a>,&nbsp<a class="tag-link" href="/worship_helps/words">Words</a><span> | </span><a href="/worship_helps/2006/08/7_worship_leadi.html"><i class="fas fa-link"></i> Permalink</a><span> | </span><a href="/worship_helps/2006/08/7_worship_leadi.html"><i class="fas fa-comment"></i> Comments (1)</a></div></article><article class="post-list"><h3 class="post-title"><a href="/worship_helps/2006/10/thanksgiving_tr.html">Thanksgiving - Tried and True, Fresh and New</a></h3><h5 class="post-date">October 22, 2006</h5><div class="post-content"><p><a href="http://worshiphelps.blogs.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/840400.jpg"><img src="/img/840400.jpg" alt="840400" title="840400"></a> On Thanksgiving Day many churches offer a very traditional worship service: Psalm 100, a litany of thanksgiving, “Come, You Thankful People, Come.” On a day when we look back with gratitude at God’s good gifts to us, it makes sense to make use of the work and wisdom of our forebears and to worship using that which is tried and true. Other congregations seek innovation: pilgrim puppets behind the pulpit, prayers of thanks colored (not written) in crayon on scraps of paper and dropped in the offering plate.</p>
<p>Our culture craves novelty, which may explain—but doesn’t necessarily commend—our thirst for it. A more laudable urge is to offer in our worship not a stale tradition, repeated out of habit, but something original: our creative expression, our prayers and words and music, our very selves. We want to offer something fresh and new. But must it be an either/or choice?  Many congregations are very successful in their efforts to examine the tried and true traditions (often more true than actually tried), identify the best in them, and then freshen them in ways sensitive to their contexts.  Here are a few ideas...</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Call to Worship</strong><br>
Psalm 100 is just the right Scripture to use as a call to worship on Thanksgiving Day. It’s familiar, and it summons God’s people both to worship and to give thanks. But the elevated diction of most psalm translations, and the formal quiet out of which calls to worship are often spoken, can diminish the psalm’s affective energy. To generate enthusiasm, some congregations bring out their best thespian/liturgist to lead the reading with strong voice and grand gesture. But the right song might work as well—if not better—to encourage rather than coerce the congregation into eager, participative praise. For example, teach and then sing the song “Come, All You People” (it can be found in the hymnal supplement <em><a href="http://www.calvin.edu/worship/pub/sing.php">Sing! A New Creation</a></em>) at the very start of the service, and let the energy leak into the responsive reading of Psalm 100 as a call to worship. Let it leak by maintaining a soft percussive pulse, and maybe a low bass drone, throughout the speaking. Then reprise the song afterward, and the service will have begun with faithfulness and vigor.  (See the music <a href="http://www.cymorthcristnogol.org/addoli/caw06/CAW06%20Act%20of%20Worship%20erratum%20music%20insert.pdf#search=%22%22come%20all%20you%20people%22%22">here</a>, hear it <a href="http://www.dogpile.com/info.dogpl/clickit/search?r_aid=2679264FAC7743AB9D8226E257697030&amp;r_eop=3&amp;r_sacop=3&amp;r_spf=0&amp;r_cop=main-title&amp;r_snpp=3&amp;r_spp=0&amp;qqn=5%40%2BeS3%24%40&amp;amp;amp;amp;r_coid=372372&amp;rawto=http://www.giamusic.com/sacred_music/audio/UyaiMo.ram">here</a>.)</p>
<p><strong>Hymn of Thanks and Praise</strong><br>
Nearly every hymnal has its share of wonderful Thanksgiving songs. “<a href="http://www.cyberhymnal.org/htm/c/o/comeytpc.htm">Come, You Thankful People, Come</a>”—despite the agricultural metaphor’s diminishing resonance with most congregations—is just one of them. Along with “<a href="http://www.cgmusic.com/cghymnal/others/letallthings.htm">Now Thank We All Our God</a>” and “<a href="http://www.cyberhymnal.org/htm/w/e/wegattog.htm">We Gather Together</a>,” these tried and true texts are rich in theology and poetry. But older songs have no monopoly on depth. “Have We Any Gift Worth Giving” (SNC 14) is a superb contemporary hymn text by Carl Daw, based on Romans 12:1. The musical setting by Al Fedak is contemporary, but in the familiar style of a Genevan psalm tune.<a class="continue" href="/worship_helps/2006/10/thanksgiving_tr.html">Continue reading...</a></div><div class="post-footer">Posted at 34:00 AM in <a class="tag-link" href="/worship_helps/music">Music</a>,&nbsp<a class="tag-link" href="/worship_helps/ordo">Ordo</a>,&nbsp<a class="tag-link" href="/worship_helps/prayer">Prayer</a>,&nbsp<a class="tag-link" href="/worship_helps/ritual">Ritual</a>,&nbsp<a class="tag-link" href="/worship_helps/theme">Theme</a>,&nbsp<a class="tag-link" href="/worship_helps/words">Words</a><span> | </span><a href="/worship_helps/2006/10/thanksgiving_tr.html"><i class="fas fa-link"></i> Permalink</a></div></article><article class="post-list"><h3 class="post-title"><a href="/worship_helps/2007/01/a_question_of_a.html">A Question of Accessibility</a></h3><h5 class="post-date">January 09, 2007</h5><div class="post-content"><p>Back in Nov., I got an insightful email from a congregant about a phrase we sang in a song during our weekend church services.  The song was &quot;Give Us Clean Hands&quot; by Charlie Hall.</p>
