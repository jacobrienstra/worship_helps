<p>No, the world belongs to God.  It has been entrusted to us, yes, but it is ultimately in God’s hands.  What a good thing for type A people to remember every day!</p>
<p>I let this lesson guide our evening prayer a few weeks ago as I led worship at the hard-working <a href="http://www.rca.org/NETCOMMUNITY/Page.aspx?pid=4155&amp;srcid=2059">General Synod</a> of the <a href="http://www.rca.org/NETCOMMUNITY/Page.aspx?pid=183&amp;srcid=2183">Reformed Church in America</a>.  We decided each night to let a particular song shape and direct our evening prayers.  So we would sing a verse and then let that verse prompt particular petitions and thanks.  So, for example, one evening we sang verses from <a href="http://www.sacramentors.org/audio/bless.mp3"><em>Bless the Lord, My Soul</em></a>, the setting of <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?new=1&amp;word=psalms+103&amp;section=0&amp;version=nrs&amp;language=en">Psalm 103</a> from <a href="http://taize.fr/">Taizé</a>.  Another evening we sang four verses from A<a href="http://www.cyberhymnal.org/htm/a/l/allprais.htm">ll Praise to Thee, My God, This Night</a>.  But my favorite was the evening we began and ended with the old gospel favorite “<a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Nina+Simone/_/He%27s+Got+the+Whole+World+in+His+Hands">He’s Got the Whole World In His Hands</a>.”</p>
<p>Planning the service, I wanted to get rid of the repeated masculine pronoun, and thought to change the lyric from “He’s” and “his” to “You’ve” and “your” (a far less clunky tweak than alternating genders or using “God’s” throughout). This had the surprising – and wonderful – effect of altering the character of the song altogether.  It shifted it from testimony to prayer; from speaking about God’s providence to speaking to God, rooting our petitions, both spoken and silent, in a confident declaration of God’s power and love: “You’ve got the whole world in your hands.”<a class="continue" href="/worship_helps/2008/06/the-whole-world.html">Continue reading...</a></div><div class="post-footer">Posted at 11:12 AM in <a class="tag-link" href="/worship_helps/music">Music</a>,&nbsp<a class="tag-link" href="/worship_helps/prayer">Prayer</a><span> | </span><a href="/worship_helps/2008/06/the-whole-world.html"><i class="fas fa-link"></i> Permalink</a></div></article><article class="post-list"><h3 class="post-title"><a href="/worship_helps/2007/07/what-is-worship.html">What is Worship?</a></h3><h5 class="post-date">July 12, 2007</h5><div class="post-content"><p>This is an article that featured Todd Johnson and Ed Willmington address the question &quot;What is Worship?&quot;  It helps to get inside of the heads of these two worship gurus.</p>

A congregation's imagination is reflected in many ways: how it shapes and reshapes its worship space, how it shapes its re-telling of biblical stories and its own congregational stories, the kinds of people who are welcomed and who feel at home, and the kinds of cultic practices it considers normative.</p>
<p>I had a pretty clear sense of the congregational imagination of the church in which I served as music director for over twenty years. The congregation had a sense of the dramatic, and this was reflected in its development of the worship space. It loved to take unusual angles in its retelling of biblical stories; it was not unusual to have worship feature a potter's wheel in the centre of the sanctuary and liturgical dance, though not frequent, was welcomed as part of normal (rather than “special” or “different”) worship.</p>
<p>I am now in a new congregation, and am still in the process of learning the scope of its imagination.</p>
<p>The congregation's imagination cannot, of course, be completely separated from that of its leadership. There is a kind of conversation that begins early in a pastor's (or other leader's) tenure, as congregation and pastor listen to one another, and develop what you might call an “image bank”, that treasure house of story, metaphor, symbol, visions and images with which it expresses its communal identity.<a class="continue" href="/worship_helps/2007/03/as_weve_been_li.html">Continue reading...</a></div><div class="post-footer">Posted at 10:46 PM<span> | </span><a href="/worship_helps/2007/03/as_weve_been_li.html"><i class="fas fa-link"></i> Permalink</a></div></article><article class="post-list"><h3 class="post-title"><a href="/worship_helps/2007/02/no_matter_how_y.html">No matter how you dress it up...</a></h3><h5 class="post-date">February 28, 2007</h5><div class="post-content"><p>Victoria Weinstein, a Unitarian Universalist minister [obviously outside of the bounds of evangelicalism] who goes by the handle PeaceBang, has launched a <a href="http://beautytipsforministers.blogspot.com/">fashion blog</a> to encourage the &quot;defrumpification of the American clergy.&quot; And in a recent <a href="http://www.boston.com/news/local/articles/2007/02/18/preaching_fashion/"><em>Boston Globe</em> story</a>, Weinstein says that even though fashion isn't the greatest concern for clergy, it still matters.</p>
<p>I read the article and I would like to put a spin on this.</p>
<p>Though Weinstein's advice is decent, especially to her target group of women ministers, her comments have implications. And I'm sure Weinstein's aim is not to cause any overt controversy, but it raises some interesting questions...one I've heard on more than one occasion.</p>

<p>The first problem is theologically inspired boredom: we are growing weary of planning and leading the same twenty minutes of “opening exercises” every week. The dominant feature of our pre-sermon worship time is a significant chunk of music interspersed with words of welcome and perhaps a prayer or two. In the past months we’ve worked hard at intentionally selecting congregational songs that have cultural breadth, theological depth, and liturgical clarity. Still, the logistics of the service (including the architectural shape of our space) leave us with a default organizational ordo with which we are increasingly uncomfortable. It is an order that feels not blessedly simple but distressingly simplistic: songs (led by a group from the right hand side), followed by a sermon (preached by a professor from the left hand side).</p>
<p>The other problems we’re struggling with are thematic coherence and sacramental expectation.</p>

His argument isn't merely theological, but liturgical: &quot;The nearly universal liturgical element of 'confession of sin and absolution' might be replaced or complemented by a 'declaration of what ails us and God's promise to us'&quot; (p. 170). He continues in a note: &quot;I am not suggesting these exact words as 'liturgical headings.' I would hope more elegant phrases could be found, but I am suggesting the notion that lies behind these words&quot; (p. 185, n. 8). Following is one attempt at more elegant phrasing for several of the images Borg mines from the Bible to describe our condition.</p>
<p><strong>Confession of Blindness and Promise of Illumination</strong></p>
<p>God of Light, we confess that our vision is impaired. Your presence is lost to us in the shadows of our world and the darkness of our hearts. We look, yet we do not see, blind to the daily opportunities to praise you and serve others. Restore our sight, we pray, in the name of Christ whose vision of your kingdom come, led him on the path of salvation.</p>
