<p>4/30/06 3rd Sunday of Easter<br>
Scripture readings: Psalm 116 and Colossians 1:15-23 (sermon text)</p>
<p>OPENING HYMN:<br>
Bb – A Shout Rings Out/Daar juicht een toon (PsH 392)<br>
    “prelude” choir sings verse 1 in Dutch<br>
    then with cong 4 verses</p>
<p>OT SCRIPTURE:<br>
Psalm 116 with “I Love the Lord” (SNC 227)<br>
(We'll volley back and forth between the reader and the people singing the song.)</p>
<p>PRE-SERMON HYMN:<br>
The First Place<br>
(A great song by Matthew Westerholm which fits the sermon scripture like a glove. I created backing vocals for the choir to fill out the refrain a bit.)</p>
<p>COMMUNION:<br>
D - God So Loved the World (choir only)<br>
D – At the Name of Jesus/Walker (JN 32)<br>
D/Eb – Oh Que Bueno (PsH 401)<br>
    (using clave, maracas and bongos to bring the rhythm to life)<br>
Eb - Beautiful Savior (JN 5)<br>
Eb – O Christ, the Great Foundation (SNC 177)<br>
    (May use the &quot;Let It Rip&quot; arrangement of the tune “Aurelia”)</p>
<p>By way of context, the congregation is Church of the Servant in Grand Rapids. It's a liturgical CRC church with strong ties to Calvin College, Calvin Seminary and the Calvin Institute of Christian Worship. Stylistically, we lean heavily on the Psalter Hymnal and Sing! a New Creation. We also use a good bit of global music, some home grown songs, and dip lightly into choral repertoire and praise and worship.</p>
<p>Peace,</p>
