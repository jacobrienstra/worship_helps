I find myself overwhelmed by rocketing gas prices, by the helplessness I feel as I pass a group of homeless men sleeping in the 99 cents store parking lot late at night, and the discontent I feel as I watch my two brothers debilitated by cancer…both with young families. Where is God? Does He care?</p>
<p><a href="http://worshiphelps.blogs.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/worshipsenses.jpg"><img src="https://worshiphelps.blogs.com/worship_helps/images/worshipsenses.jpg" alt="Worshipsenses" title="Worshipsenses"></a> Then I happened upon Don Saliers’ book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0687014581/ref=pd_bxgy_img_a/103-5407787-3041462?%5Fencoding=UTF8"><em>Worship Comes to Its Senses</em></a> (Abingdon Press, Nashville, 1996), which makes me come to my senses, changing my vantage point, to God’s perspective. I realized that my problems were larger than life because I did not think &quot;highly&quot; of God, I had lost my sense of awe. In Matthew 9, some friends bring their paralyzed friend to see Jesus. Jesus said to the man, “Get up, take your mat and go home” (Matt. 9:6). Then in verse 7, the crowd was “filled with awe, and they praised God”. The crowd's view of God was enlarged! They praise God with awe.</p>
<p>Saliers encourages us to reconnect real life to the worship of the God of the Universe!</p>
<p>He accents Jaroslav Vajda’s new hymn “God of the Sparrow God of the Whale” which crosses generational lines and is a contemporary way to express to our awe in biblical tradition.  Lyrics after the jump...</div><a class="continue" href="/worship_helps/2006/06/igniting_a_sens.html">Continue reading...</a></article><article class="post-list"><h3 class="post-title"><a href="/worship_helps/2006/06/childrens_hymns.html">Children's Hymns in Worship</a></h3><h5 class="post-date">June 03, 2006</h5><div class="post-content"><p>I love singing with children - (well, most of the time, but that part doesn't come into this story). They soak up words and melodies like sponges, storing them away and pouring them out at every opportunity, “in season and out of season” - as the parents in our church ruefully attest.</p>
<p>What makes a good children's hymn? Or a good song for young people? Nobody I know, and no-one I've ever read, has ever come up with the formula.</p>
<p>The problem is compounded by the fact that children will gleefully and confidently sing a song that is not at all what we think of as a “children's” hymn. Three-and-a-half year-old Joseph in our church can sing “Kwase, Kwase/Be Like Him” by Kirk Franklin, or join his (younger) brother Benjamin in a duet of “U ya-i mose” from Zimbabwe. (Two-year old Benjamin sings the bass part.) And, while I'm thinking of it, I remember 11- and 12-year-olds singing - lustily and with good courage - Charles Wesley's “And can it be that I should gain” at every opportunity at summer camp.</p>
<p>Then there's the practical challenge. In the classic worship situation, children troop up to the front for the Children's Sermon while we adults sing verse 1 and 2 of a hymn that mentions children. Then, as they head off to Sunday School, we sing the 3rd and final verse. We might be singing a worthy hymn, but we are really using it as walking music, a sung processional and recessional to frame the children's time up at the front.</div><a class="continue" href="/worship_helps/2006/06/childrens_hymns.html">Continue reading...</a></article><article class="post-list"><h3 class="post-title"><a href="/worship_helps/2006/06/the_contemporar.html">The Contemporary Desert</a></h3><h5 class="post-date">June 19, 2006</h5><div class="post-content"><p>Everyone wants heightened spirituality, but don’t know what it takes to get there. Most pastors and worship leaders have such a hectic schedule that it is impossible to slowdown enough for quiet time or solitude. Yet the Apostolic Fathers of faith placed a high value on it.</p>
<p>If leaders have a problem with carving out quiet moments can you imagine what the congregation is feeling? Jonny Baker and Doug Gay’s <em>Alternative Worship: Resources from and for the Emerging Church</em>, provides a “ritual” that contextualizes the spiritual practice of being in the desert that can be used as part of a worship service, small group gathering, or as teaching illustration.</p>
<p>Items needed: Removed Van seat, a boom box, selection of CD’s (ideally instrumental), a video projector and VCR. Video tape a drive down the highway, even being stuck in traffic, or driving through the city.</p>
<p>Description: Traveling in a car is the closest thing for most people get to solitude. “Setting up this ritual will hopefully help people to reflect positively on the space they have next time they are driving alone in the car” (Baker and Gay, Alternative Worship, Baker Books, Grand Rapids, 2004, 86)</div><a class="continue" href="/worship_helps/2006/06/the_contemporar.html">Continue reading...</a></article><article class="post-list"><h3 class="post-title"><a href="/worship_helps/2006/06/tradition_from_.html">Tradition</a></h3><h5 class="post-date">June 28, 2006</h5><div class="post-content"><p>It often seems that tradition is in the eyes of the beholder.</p>
<p>A friend visited for a while with our large suburban congregation and suggested that what she discovered was a heritage of worship that was part town hall meeting, part local talent show, and part lecture series. Perhaps there are other congregations whose Ordo follows in a similar path.</p>
<p>As pastor of the congregation for a little over two years, I have been faced with a number of questions related to local tradition. Making appeals to the great traditions of the church and faith don’t carry much freight for people who mark tradition according to what their parents taught them or what the last great preacher suggested.</p>
<p>For large churches, change often comes slowly with much conversation – especially if change is rare and sometimes has been disastrous.</div><a class="continue" href="/worship_helps/2006/06/tradition_from_.html">Continue reading...</a></article><article class="post-list"><h3 class="post-title"><a href="/worship_helps/2006/06/here_is_an_idea.html">Wading by the Water</a></h3><h5 class="post-date">June 30, 2006</h5><div class="post-content"><p>Here is an idea to strengthen you experience of baptismal renewal. Take a walk! <a href="http://worshiphelps.blogs.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/river_2.jpg"><img src="https://worshiphelps.blogs.com/worship_helps/images/river_2.jpg" alt="River_2" title="River_2"></a></p>
<p>This may not sound very revolutionary, but any movement at all in my congregation carries the threat of something going awry. Our large mainline congregation typically restricts its movement to arriving, standing, sitting, and departing. Now we are about to take a walk together past the baptismal waters as a sign of remembrance and renewal.</p>
<p>We are about to reflect together upon the story of Peter walking on water. His first steps brought the threat of sinking. Our steps bring the threat of tripping over someone’s walker or stepping on a neighbor’s foot. – As the pastor receiving Monday morning quarterbacking, I’m not sure which is scarier!</p>
<p>Placed in the context of Peter’s walk, our congregational journey will be just a token of the faithful risk we are called to share. Members will bring their offerings forward as they physically move toward the front of the sanctuary. (I’m told there are some African communities where this act of offering is the most joyful and powerful part of the service!) Upon placing their offering (and their heart!) before the Lord, they will pass the baptismal waters and be given opportunity to touch the water and remember God’s claim on their lives.</div><a class="continue" href="/worship_helps/2006/06/here_is_an_idea.html">Continue reading...</a></article></div><div class="column col-3-of-3"><section class="categories"><h4 class="title"> <a href="/worship_helps/archives.html">Categories</a></h4><ul class="container"><li><a class="link" href="/worship_helps/Alt/">Alt</a></li><li><a class="link" href="/worship_helps/Church Year/">Church Year</a></li><li><a class="link" href="/worship_helps/Daily Prayer/">Daily Prayer</a></li><li><a class="link" href="/worship_helps/Drama/">Drama</a></li><li><a class="link" href="/worship_helps/Lectionary Texts/">Lectionary Texts</a></li><li><a class="link" href="/worship_helps/Music/">Music</a></li><li><a class="link" href="/worship_helps/Ordo/">Ordo</a></li><li><a class="link" href="/worship_helps/Prayer/">Prayer</a></li><li><a class="link" href="/worship_helps/Preaching/">Preaching</a></li><li><a class="link" href="/worship_helps/Ritual/">Ritual</a></li><li><a class="link" href="/worship_helps/Technology/">Technology</a></li><li><a class="link" href="/worship_helps/Theme/">Theme</a></li><li><a class="link" href="/worship_helps/Visual Art/">Visual Art</a></li><li><a class="link" href="/worship_helps/Web/Tech/">Web/Tech</a></li><li><a class="link" href="/worship_helps/Words/">Words</a></li></ul></section><section class="archives"><h4 class="title"> <a href="/worship_helps/archives.html">Archives</a></h4><ul class="container"> <li><a class="link" href="/worship_helps/2020/04/">April 2020</a></li><li><a class="link" href="/worship_helps/2008/06/">June 2008</a></li><li><a class="link" href="/worship_helps/2007/07/">July 2007</a></li><li><a class="link" href="/worship_helps/2007/03/">March 2007</a></li><li><a class="link" href="/worship_helps/2007/02/">February 2007</a></li><li><a class="link" href="/worship_helps/2007/01/">January 2007</a></li><li><a class="link" href="/worship_helps/2006/12/">December 2006</a></li><li><a class="link" href="/worship_helps/2006/11/">November 2006</a></li><li><a class="link" href="/worship_helps/2006/10/">October 2006</a></li><li><a class="link" href="/worship_helps/2006/09/">September 2006</a></li><li><a class="link" href="/worship_helps/2006/08/">August 2006</a></li><li><a class="link" href="/worship_helps/2006/07/">July 2006</a></li><li><a class="link" href="/worship_helps/2006/06/">June 2006</a></li><li><a class="link" href="/worship_helps/2006/05/">May 2006</a></li><li><a class="link" href="/worship_helps/2006/04/">April 2006</a></li><li><a class="link" href="/worship_helps/2006/02/">February 2006</a></li><li><a class="link" href="/worship_helps/2006/01/">January 2006</a></li><li><a class="link" href="/worship_helps/2005/12/">December 2005</a></li></ul></section></div></div></div></body></html>
