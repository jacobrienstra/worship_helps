<p>After the Invitation to the Lord’s Table, Eucharistic Prayer, and Words of Institution, a worshiper who was chosen before the service began, took an empty water bottle and spun it on the floor of the Chapel. When it came to a stop, the first worshiper and the worshiper toward whom the bottle was pointing met in the middle of the Chapel, exchanged the Mar Thoma Kiss of Peace, and then went to the communion table and served the Eucharist to each other.</p>

<p>Then the next worshiper spun the bottle and met the person toward whom it pointed in the middle of the Chapel. They exchanged the Mar Thoma Kiss of Peace and went to the Table and served the Sacrament to each other.</p>
<p>We learned about the “Mar Thoma” Kiss of Peace from an Austin College student who was part of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mar_Thoma_Syrian_Church_of_India">Mar Thoma Church of India</a>. We have begun to use it often in our worship because it is an appropriate and non-threatening way for worshipers to touch each other.</p>
<p>![](file:///C:/DOCUME~1/RONRIE~1/LOCALS~1/Temp/msohtml1/01/clip_image002.jpg) To exchange the Mar Thoma Kiss of Peace, two worshipers face each other, extend their hands forward, and then touch hands so that the right hand of each worshiper is between the palms of the two hands of the other. One worshiper then says, “The peace of Christ be with you,” and the other responds, “And also with you.”</p>
<p>Students find this to be an enriching part of worship because—with a little assisted reflection—they realize that they might be paired with a close friend or they might be paired with a fellow worshiper whom they had not even known before the service began. In either case, worshipers are reminded that our lives as Christians—as the Body of Christ in the world—might involve both those to whom we are closest and others who we may not know at all.</p>
