We are also called to nurture each other in the faith.<a href="http://worshiphelps.blogs.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/imr00035.jpg"><img src="https://worshiphelps.blogs.com/worship_helps/images/imr00035.jpg" alt="Imr00035" title="Imr00035"></a></p>
<p>Remembering our baptism this Mother’s Day may be a way to honor both the season of Easter and mothers.  You may begin the service standing by the font, giving thanks for water, God’s promises to us and reminding the community of the promises we make to each other during the time of baptism.  One resource for remembering baptism can be found from the ELCA’s <a href="http://www.elca.org/dcm/worship/worship/sacraments/baptism.html">Holy Baptism and Related Rites</a>.  Perhaps on this day we can accentuate the vows to love and care for one another.  This is a way you can talk about how mothers, at their best, who live into these promises of baptism through their care and nurture of children (not just their own but all children of the community).  In this way mothers, and Mother’s Day points back to baptism and a life in Christ as opposed to the worship pointing to a cultural holiday.</p>
