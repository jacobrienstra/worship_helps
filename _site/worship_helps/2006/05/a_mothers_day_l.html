<p><strong>Mothers’ Day Liturgy</strong></p>
<p>Lord, on this day set aside to honor and remember mothers, we give you thanks for our mothers. We are grateful that you chose to give us life through them, and that they received the gift of life from your hands, and gave it to us. Thank you for the sacrifices they made in carrying us and giving us birth.</p>
<p>We thank you for the women who raised us, who were our mothers in childhood. Whether birth mom, adopted mom, older sister, aunt, grandmother, stepmother or someone else, we thank you for those women who held us and fed us, who cared for us and kissed away our pain. We pray that our lives may reflect the love they showed us, and that they would be pleased to be called our moms.</p>

<p>We pray for all women who have assumed the mother’s role in a child’s life.</p>
<p><strong>Grant them joy and the appreciation of others.</strong></p>
<p>We pray for those people present who are grieving the loss of their mother in the past year.</p>
<p><strong>Grant them comfort and hope in Christ’s resurrection.</strong></p>
<p><em>All mothers, women, and girls are invited to come to the front of the sanctuary to receive a blessing through prayer and the laying on of hands.</em></p>
<p>Lord, we thank you for the gift of motherhood. We thank you for the many examples of faithful mothers in scripture, like Sarah, Hannah, Elizabeth, and Lois. Hear now the first names of other women who have inspired us by their motherly examples . . . We are mindful this day of all these women, and especially Mary the mother of our Lord Jesus Christ, who had the courage in faith to say “yes” to your calling. May these women gathered here today emulate these examples of faith. And may they model for all the rest of us what it means to be your disciple. Bless them on this special day; in the name of Jesus Christ. <strong>Amen</strong>.</p>
