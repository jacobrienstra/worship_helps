<!DOCTYPE html><html><head><title>Worship Helps</title></head><body><header><h1>Worship Helps</h1><h6>A collection of resources and commentary for those who plan and lead weekly Christian worship</h6></header><div class="post-content"><p>Paul’s sermon in Athens (Acts 17:22-31) is substantially different from any of his other sermons. While his other sermons are identifiably Pharisaical and present the gospel in a way that would be accessible to a predominantly Jewish audience, the Athenian sermon employs patterns and concepts which were common to first century Athens. It is a significant and noteworthy accomplishment on Paul’s part and it may be taken as a mandate to subsequent Christians always to be prepared to articulate the gospel message using new and distinct cultural patterns. While the content of the Gospel is always consistent, the form in which the good news of Jesus Christ is presented should always be flexible. What follows are excerpts from a somewhat playful worship service that was designed to illustrate to a worshiping community the issues and possibilities involved in attempting to articulate a Christian worship service in a particular context.   College students, youth, and children are often engaged by this way of distinguishing between what is essential and what is negotiable in worship.   Read the liturgy after the jump.</p>

<p>WORDS OF INSTITUTION</p>
<p>The night Jesus Christ was betrayed to the feds</p>
<p>Our Savior stood up after supper and said,</p>
<p>“This here is my body—right here in this bread.</p>
<p>And this cup holds my blood which for you will be shed.</p>
<p>And when you eat this bread and drink juice or Chablis</p>
<p>I want you to act in remembrance of me.</p>
<p>For in this holy meal, good <em>madames</em> and <em>monsieurs</em>,</p>
<p>My body and life will become part of yours.”</p>
<p>SHARING OF THE ELEMENTS</p>
<p>“The Body of Christ, which was broken for you.</p>
<p>` The Blood of our Lord, which was shed for you, too.”</p>
<p>LORD’S PRAYER (Unison)</p>
<p><strong>Our Father who in heaven art</strong></p>
<p><strong>Respected be your name</strong></p>
<p><strong>Thy kingdom come; thy will be done</strong></p>
<p><strong>In Heav’n and Earth the same</strong></p>
<p><strong>Our daily bread, please, to us give</strong></p>
<p><strong>Forgive our sins as we forgive</strong></p>
<p><strong>Don’t lead us where we might be tempted</strong></p>
<p><strong>But make all evil things preempted</strong></p>
<p><strong>Yours is the kingdom, pow’r, and glory</strong></p>
<p><strong>And that will always be the story.</strong></p>
<p>CHARGE AND BENEDICTION</p>
<p>Now go be courageous and peaceful and good</p>
<p>Act beloved and gifted like you know you should</p>
<p>And always remember the point of it all</p>
<p>A person’s a person no matter how small.</p>
