All of life, for those of us born of water and the Spirit, is wet. In other words, every moment of each day is grounded in baptism. Even if we are not following the will of God, those moments are redeemed in God’s grace, which is one aspect of baptism (cleansing from or forgiveness of sin). This is why confession or at least a reflection on how we “missed the mark” or sinned is a part of the compline prayer. The ancient “compline” prayer, or prayer at the close of the day shapes our sleeping and rising in the death and resurrection of Christ. This image is one of baptismal life; continually dying (repenting and turning from ways that separate us from Christ) and rising to new life each day.</p>
<p>Throughout the worship service there are several moments each Sunday where we can engage water in ways that help us understand and live more deeply into our baptism. Here are a few examples:</p>
<p><strong>During the gathering of the people</strong> you can pour water into the font or baptismal pool with words that accentuate our inclusion into the family of God such as:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>You are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, God’s own people, in order that you m ay proclaim the mighty acts of the One who called you out of darkness into God’s marvelous light</em>. (1 Peter 2:9)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>After confession</strong>, you may pour or splash water while you while declaring God’s grace and forgiveness. Any words of forgiveness and grace accentuate baptism. However, you may use words that are more explicit:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Do you not know that all of us who have been baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death? Therefore we have been buried with him by baptism into death, so that, just as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, so we too might walk in newness of life.</em> (Romans 6:3,4) <em>Know that you are forgiven and be at peace, walking in the light of Christ, loving God with all your being and loving your neighbor as yourself.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Calling for the offering</strong> is a great place to remind people of the promises they have made at baptism. We promise to follow Christ, obey his word, love God and one another and live our lives in ways that show Christ’s love in this world. Our best offering is the way we live. While money is important, how we make that money and our priorities in the way we spend money are also part of living into our baptism. The way we live each minute of the day is our best and most important offering, even more important that anything that has to do with money. Too often the offering seems to revolve around money, especially when we process plates of money down the aisle singing a doxology. What are ways we can expand our offering to include living the baptismal life?</p>
<p><strong>Sending</strong> people into the world is another place where the image of water can remind us that we leave this place to live into our baptism. Perhaps you could use such words as this while pouring or splashing water:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>We are the people of God, members of the household of faith, a royal priesthood. Let us proclaim with our lives the good news of Christ for all the world!</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>These images are just scratching the surface of the mystery of baptism. There are many more aspect of this life we live in faith and many more ways to express it. The Presbyterian Church USA is inviting all its member churches into five practices each Sunday:</p>
<p><strong>1. Set the font in full view of the congregation.<br>
2. Open the font and fill it with water on every Lord’s Day.</strong></p>
<p><strong>3. Set cup and plate on the Lord’s Table on every Lord’s Day.</strong></p>
<p><strong>4. Lead appropriate parts of weekly worship from the font and from the table.<br>
5. Increase the number of Sundays on which the Lord’s Supper is celebrated.</strong></p>
<p>You can read the whole report, including supporting material that is helpful for studying and reflecting on baptismal life at <a href="http://pcusa.org/theologyandworship/worship/sacramentworkgroup.htm">http://pcusa.org/theologyandworship/worship/sacramentworkgroup.htm</a></p>
<p>By engaging in these practices each Sunday we can begin to explore how baptism is a part of every aspect of Christian living. Just a few examples would be forgiving others, caring for creation, what we do at our jobs (or our vocation), the way we spend money, we interact with others, all this is grounded in the life of faith which is the baptismal life. The mysteries of the faith are never fully exhausted. These practices can be explored each and every time the community of faith gathers and even in our daily prayer.</p>
