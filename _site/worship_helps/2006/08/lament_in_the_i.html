<p><a href="http://worshiphelps.blogs.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/lament.jpg"><img src="https://worshiphelps.blogs.com/worship_helps/images/lament.jpg" alt="Lament" title="Lament"></a> One interesting way to encourage folks to pray prayers of lament (whether publically or privately) is to prompt the prayers with an interrogative word, like &quot;why&quot; or &quot;where&quot; or &quot;when&quot; or &quot;how long.&quot;  (The phrase &quot;how long&quot;, in fact, is used over 20 times in the Psalms alone.)  This way, our prayers for peace in the Middle East, for example, are not merely petitions for wise leadership; they become  expressions of our own helplessness: &quot;When, O Lord, will your children in the Middle East stop firing rockets at one another?&quot;</p>
<p>After the jump is a short devotional service based on this idea.  It embeds the prayer of lament within both a sung Kyrie and a concluding Alleluia.  It also contextualizes the prayer  -- both the lament and the declaration of God's ultimate sovereignty -- as continuous with the &quot;words of the faithful in all times and places.&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>How long, O Lord?<br>
Will you forget me forever?<br>
How long will you hide your face from me?<br>
How long must I bear pain in my soul,<br>
and have sorrow in my heart all day long?<br>
How long shall my enemy be exalted over me?<br>
Consider and answer me, O Lord my God!<br>
Give light to my eyes,<br>
or I will sleep the sleep of death,<br>
and my enemy will say, “I have prevailed”;<br>
my foes will rejoice because I am shaken.  (Psalm 13: 1-4)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Hear the words of the faithful in all times and places:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But I trusted in your steadfast love;<br>
my heart shall rejoice in your salvation.<br>
I will sing to the Lord,<br>
because he has dealt bountifully with me. (Psalm 13: 5-6)</p>
</blockquote>
