<p><a href="http://worshiphelps.blogs.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/lament.jpg"><img src="https://worshiphelps.blogs.com/worship_helps/images/lament.jpg" alt="Lament" title="Lament"></a> One interesting way to encourage folks to pray prayers of lament (whether publically or privately) is to prompt the prayers with an interrogative word, like &quot;why&quot; or &quot;where&quot; or &quot;when&quot; or &quot;how long.&quot;  (The phrase &quot;how long&quot;, in fact, is used over 20 times in the Psalms alone.)  This way, our prayers for peace in the Middle East, for example, are not merely petitions for wise leadership; they become  expressions of our own helplessness: &quot;When, O Lord, will your children in the Middle East stop firing rockets at one another?&quot;</p>
<p>After the jump is a short devotional service based on this idea.  It embeds the prayer of lament within both a sung Kyrie and a concluding Alleluia.  It also contextualizes the prayer  -- both the lament and the declaration of God's ultimate sovereignty -- as continuous with the &quot;words of the faithful in all times and places.&quot;</p>

<p>His parents were eager to do this because their families -- on both sides -- have deep connections to the &quot;Big Lake&quot; as home. In the service, I pointed to the appropriateness of the link the water made between family initiation and initiation into the larger family of God.</p>
<p>But more than that, I suggested that using water from this natural resource -- so dominant and precious to us in the midwest -- highlights the deep connection between the grace of God offered in baptism and the responsibility we gratefully take on as Christ's disciples to care for the world in which that grace is manifest.  It says something damning to us if the water in our backyard streams, or rivers, or lakes is so polluted that we cannot in good common sense bathe in it, or in good conscience call it &quot;living&quot; water.  Perhaps my nephew Samuel will grow up, in service to Jesus, to be a biologist who concerns himself with the health of Lakes Michigan, Superior, Huron, Ontario, and Erie.</p>

<p>I was thinking about all of this yesterday as I visited a local Children's Sculpture Garden and watched my own children play in a large reproduction of the Great Lakes.<a class="continue" href="/worship_helps/2006/08/living_water.html">Continue reading...</a></div><div class="post-footer">Posted at 27:00 PM in <a class="tag-link" href="/worship_helps/alt">Alt</a>,&nbsp<a class="tag-link" href="/worship_helps/ritual">Ritual</a><span> | </span><a href="/worship_helps/2006/08/living_water.html"><i class="fas fa-link"></i> Permalink</a></div></article><article class="post-list"><h3 class="post-title"><a href="/worship_helps/2006/08/living_wet.html">Living Wet</a></h3><h5 class="post-date">August 14, 2006</h5><div class="post-content"><p>Ron’s story about baptizing his nephew and the connections of baptism to our care for creation show how multifaceted the layers of this sacrament are. All of life, for those of us born of water and the Spirit, is wet. In other words, every moment of each day is grounded in baptism. Even if we are not following the will of God, those moments are redeemed in God’s grace, which is one aspect of baptism (cleansing from or forgiveness of sin). This is why confession or at least a reflection on how we “missed the mark” or sinned is a part of the compline prayer. The ancient “compline” prayer, or prayer at the close of the day shapes our sleeping and rising in the death and resurrection of Christ. This image is one of baptismal life; continually dying (repenting and turning from ways that separate us from Christ) and rising to new life each day.</p>
<p>Throughout the worship service there are several moments each Sunday where we can engage water in ways that help us understand and live more deeply into our baptism. Here are a few examples:</p>
<p><strong>During the gathering of the people</strong> you can pour water into the font or baptismal pool with words that accentuate our inclusion into the family of God such as:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>You are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, God’s own people, in order that you m ay proclaim the mighty acts of the One who called you out of darkness into God’s marvelous light</em>.

He has a PhD on the Emerging Church and a Masters in Theology in communicating the cross in a postmodern world. Steve recently did a course at Fuller Seminary entitled “Communicating the Biblical Text in a PostModern Culture” in July.</p>
<p>He argues that to communicate the biblical text for today’s context requires one to “incarnate, indwell, our culture.”  Taylor goes on to use the phrase “DJing” with respect to the community.  A record DJ learns the historical stories (old records) and uses them authentically in contemporary culture and integrates them into the community's stories.  There is too much to summarize here, but do look for his book “<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0310259045/sr=8-1/qid=1155843286/ref=sr_1_1/002-0739142-4980844?ie=UTF8">The Out of Bounds Church: Learning to Create a Community of Faith in a Culture of Change</a>” from Zondervan.</p>
<p>Taylor cites Bono of U2 as a person who effectively DJs today.  According to Taylor, Bono is in fact a worship leader for over 40,000 people; Bono recontextualizes the biblical text and leads concert goers into a time of community worship and prayer. Taylor plays the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000BNXDE6/sr=8-1/qid=1155843384/ref=pd_bbs_1/002-0739142-4980844?ie=UTF8">“Vertigo ‘05” DVD</a> and shows us how Bono is leading worship.  This intrigued me to the point that  Dr. Taylor and I discussed this further after the workshop. The following is from Steve’s article <a href="mailto:www.emergentkiwi.org.nz/archives/7_things_i_learnt_from_bono_about_worship_leading.php">“7 Things I learnt from Bono about Worship Leading.”</a></p>
<p><strong>1.    Connect uniquely.</strong> In the Vertigo DVD, Bono speaks about Chicago and his memories of Chicago. He makes a unique connection with context, day, and time.<br>
<strong>2.    Engage through familiarity.</strong> Bono includes songs that resonate with previous experiences and previous encounters.<br>
<strong>3.    Use repetition to call forth prayer.</strong> Bono uses the repetitive “Hallelujah.” It is easy to sing. The simple repetition enables the audience to sing with the band.<br>
<strong>4.    Secure a 5th (visual) band member.</strong> U2 now has a 5th member of the band to add a visual layer to the experience. A wise worship leader will look to add not just singers or musicians, but a “visual” person to their team.<br>
<strong>5.    Create hope by drawing the best from the past.</strong> Bono tells the audience in the Vertigo DVD, “We as a band are looking to the future. We’re taking the best of the past and moving forward with hope.”<br>
<strong>6.    Plan participation.</strong> Bono can draw one boy from the audience to sing to, one woman from the audience to dance with. He uses repetition to call forth prayer and encourage congregational singing.<br>
<strong>7.    Invoke passionate practices.</strong> Bono invites the audience to hall out their cell phones and to text “Make Poverty History campaign.”  A worship leader turns singing into action. He turns entertainment into justice.<a class="continue" href="/worship_helps/2006/08/7_worship_leadi.html">Continue reading...</a></div><div class="post-footer">Posted at 46:39 PM in <a class="tag-link" href="/worship_helps/music">Music</a>,&nbsp<a class="tag-link" href="/worship_helps/ordo">Ordo</a>,&nbsp<a class="tag-link" href="/worship_helps/prayer">Prayer</a>,&nbsp<a class="tag-link" href="/worship_helps/preaching">Preaching</a>,&nbsp<a class="tag-link" href="/worship_helps/ritual">Ritual</a>,&nbsp<a class="tag-link" href="/worship_helps/technology">Technology</a>,&nbsp<a class="tag-link" href="/worship_helps/theme">Theme</a>,&nbsp<a class="tag-link" href="/worship_helps/visual_art">Visual Art</a>,&nbsp<a class="tag-link" href="/worship_helps/words">Words</a><span> | </span><a href="/worship_helps/2006/08/7_worship_leadi.html"><i class="fas fa-link"></i> Permalink</a></div></article><article class="post-list"><h3 class="post-title"><a href="/worship_helps/2006/08/planning_contem.html">Planning 'Contemporary' Worship Services</a></h3><h5 class="post-date">August 24, 2006</h5><div class="post-content"><p>For a fine article about 'contemporary' worship -- structure, style, planning, etc. -- that features some of the authors of this blog, click <a href="http://www.calvin.edu/worship/stories/contemp_wrshp.php">here</a>.</p>
