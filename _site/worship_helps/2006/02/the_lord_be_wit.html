Sometimes there'd be a time of teaching new music.   Sometimes there would be a song that felt like a prelude.  Other times there were announcements.</p>
<p>We wanted to create a dramatic launch to the service (&quot;Here we go!&quot;) without succumbing to the cultural forces that pull us toward making the whole thing an entertaining show (&quot;Ladies and Gentlemen!  Your attention please!&quot;)</p>
<p>We decided to begin with an appropriate greeting -- in the Lord's name, if not in the Lord's voice -- and then remind each other of why we've gathered: to worship, to renew the covenant of grace between God and God's people.  What we came up with was a short opening song.  Click <a href="http://worshiphelps.blogs.com/TLBWY.opening.pdf">here</a> for the music in lead sheet format.  And <a href="http://worshiphelps.blogs.com/TLBWY.opening.mp3">here</a> for an Mp3 recording.</p>
<p>It's free for anyone's use - but do report that use to CCLI.</p>
