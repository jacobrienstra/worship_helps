<p>But then there is another difficulty: what is the appropriate response to lament?  After a confession, we long to hear words of God's forgiveness:  &quot;As far as the east is from the west, so far do I remove your transgressions from you.&quot;  This doesn't seem quite right when we're talking about racism and environmental degradation and cancer.</p>
<p>But a declaration of God's ultimate sovereignty is exactly right -- it follows the Biblical pattern (see, for instance, <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?new=1&amp;word=psalm+42&amp;section=0&amp;version=nrs&amp;language=en">Psalm 42</a> or 43), and it assures us (just as an assurance of pardon) that in the end, all will be well, and all manner of things will be well.</p>
