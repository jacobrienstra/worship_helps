<p>But here's the thing--the testimony had to do with what they did with their share of an offering that had been taken some weeks before.  Apparently as a response to a sermon on the parable of the talents, that week's offering was divided up and given _back_ to the various households of the church.  They were then instructed to use their share to invest in the Kingdom.</p>
<p>One family testified of their confab at which they discussed what to do with their money.  They decided to buy a sheep for someone through the <a href="http://www.heifer.org/">Heifer Project</a>.  But they didn't have enough money to do it.  So each of the family members did something to try to earn more.  The things were pretty typical: the teenage son mowed lawns on a Saturday, the young girl did a lemonade stand.  In the end, they augmented what they had been given and had enough for the Sheep and a few chickens, too.</p>
<p>File this one as a fabulous theological connection between life and liturgy.</p>
