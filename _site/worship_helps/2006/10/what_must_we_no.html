<p>The Bible offers many examples of the sorts of things worshippers do when they assemble:  the Old Testament records in great detail what Temple worship was supposed to look like, including the specifics of animal and agricultural sacrifices.  The gospel of Luke tells of reading from the scriptures as part of synogogue worship.  Acts 2 tells us that the early church devoted itself to the &quot;apostles' teaching and fellowship, to the breaking of bread and the prayers.&quot;  So my question is this:  what are the non-negotiables of worship?  When God's people gather, by the power of the Holy Spirit, to renew the convenant of grace in Christ Jesus, what stuff do we do?  What actions do we perform that are non-negotiable?  If we gather to worship and never hear a sermon, is it worship?  If we don't break bread at the table, have we worshipped?  If we don't pray., or sing...  You get the idea.  What do you think?  Post your comments.</p>
