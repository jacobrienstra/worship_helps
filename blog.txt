Years ago, when I worked as a chaplain at <a href="http://www.central.edu/">Central College</a>, I had a colleague who used to get together with me regularly to pray for our students.&nbsp; We did so not only because we believed it would make a difference for them, but because we knew it made a difference for us.&nbsp; Praying for Jennifer and Scott as they worked through the pain of their parents’ divorces in anticipation of being married themselves, praying for Kim as she struggled with anorexia, with Mark as he battled addiction – these prayers helped remind us that though we are to be faithful and diligent in the ministries God has given us, in the end the sun does not rise, and the crops do not grow, and people are not made whole, and the kingdom does not come by dint of our own effort.</p>

<p>No, the world belongs to God.&nbsp; It has been entrusted to us, yes, but it is ultimately in God’s hands.&nbsp; What a good thing for type A people to remember every day! </p>

<p>I let this lesson guide our evening prayer a few weeks ago as I led worship at the hard-working <a href="http://www.rca.org/NETCOMMUNITY/Page.aspx?pid=4155&amp;srcid=2059">General Synod</a> of the <a href="http://www.rca.org/NETCOMMUNITY/Page.aspx?pid=183&amp;srcid=2183">Reformed Church in America</a>.&nbsp; We decided each night to let a particular song shape and direct our evening prayers.&nbsp; So we would sing a verse and then let that verse prompt particular petitions and thanks.&nbsp; So, for example, one evening we sang verses from <a href="http://www.sacramentors.org/audio/bless.mp3"><em>Bless the Lord, My Soul</em></a>, the setting of <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?new=1&amp;word=psalms+103&amp;section=0&amp;version=nrs&amp;language=en">Psalm 103</a> from <a href="http://taize.fr/">Taizé</a>.&nbsp; Another evening we sang four verses from A<a href="https://hymnary.org/text/all_praise_to_thee_my_god_this_night">ll Praise to Thee, My God, This Night</a>.&nbsp; 

But my favorite was the evening we began and ended with the old gospel favorite “<a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Nina+Simone/_/He%27s+Got+the+Whole+World+in+His+Hands">He’s Got the Whole World In His Hands</a>.”&nbsp; </p>

<p>Planning the service, I wanted to get rid of the repeated masculine pronoun, and thought to change the lyric from “He’s” and “his” to “You’ve” and “your” (a far less clunky tweak than alternating genders or using “God’s” throughout). This had the surprising – and wonderful – effect of altering the character of the song altogether.&nbsp; It shifted it from testimony to prayer; from speaking about God’s providence to speaking to God, rooting our petitions, both spoken and silent, in a confident declaration of God’s power and love: “You’ve got the whole world in your hands.”&nbsp; </p>

<p>Musically, I played a James Taylor-esque accompaniment (think “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sW7Z1VttPKk">Secret of Life</a>” -- Key of A, capo III), and even wrote a couple extra lines, riffing on the old hymn “<a href="https://hymnary.org/text/sing_praise_to_god_who_reigns_above">Sing Praise to God who Reigns Above</a>” as a break leading into the final chorus. </p>

<p>For the shape of the prayer itself, we allowed the song’s verses to suggest thematic areas for prayer (“tiny little baby” = family concerns;&nbsp; “wind and the rain” = creation care, etc.)&nbsp; I then augmented those verses, following <a href="https://www.reformedworship.org/article/march-2008/standing-holy-ground">my own advice</a> to speak with emotional specificity for the lost and the lonely, the weak and the wounded, the whole and the hopeful. </p>

<p>This is an article that featured Todd Johnson and Ed Willmington address the question
&quot;What is Worship?&quot;&nbsp; It helps to get inside of the heads of these two
worship gurus.</p>

<p>http://www.fuller.edu/news/html/pastors_bkfst1106.asp</p>

<p><strong>Pastors’ Gathering Explores Worship Issues</strong><br />
<br />
Worship was the topic of Fuller’s semiannual President’s Breakfast for
Pastors held Thursday, November 9, with speakers Todd Johnson and Ed
Willmington, both of the Brehm Center for Worship, Theology, and the
Arts. More than 100 attended the event in Payton Hall.<br />
<br />
“What and who is our worship for? Why do we worship?” These must be
central questions we ask in our churches, said Todd Johnson, the
William K. and Delores S. Brehm Associate Professor of Worship,
Theology and the Arts at Fuller. In his talk “Worship Choices: Going
Beyond the Categories,” Johnson discussed what we can learn from early
church worship history, and then went on to offer pastors some “neutral
terms to help you evaluate what you are doing in your worship, and
why.” Professor and author Lester Ruth offers three helpful questions
we can ask, he said: First, whose story is being told in your
worship—God’s story, or the individual’s story of coming to faith?
Second, who do you understand your church to be when you worship—one
part of the larger corporate church, or a more autonomous, homegrown
congregation? And lastly, where do people find God in your church’s
worship—in the Word, table, or music? It is helpful to understand who
you are as a church and work to strike a balance between these
different elements, Johnson said.<br />
<br />
“A Pastoral Approach to Local Church Worship” was the topic of a second
talk given by Ed Willmington, director of the Brehm Center’s Fred Bock
Institute of Music. First considering how pastors and worship leaders
relate to each other, Willmington emphasized the need for a strong
level of trust and communication between the two. When bringing worship
leaders and musicians into your church, “look past the talent—look for
a servant heart,” he urged, and also noted the importance of providing
spiritual support and direction to worship team members. “Who is
walking alongside them?” he asked. Moving to the pastor-congregation
relationship, Willmington stressed the importance of studying and
preaching specifically about worship. Congregants need to understand,
he said, that “worship is a verb—something you do, not something that
is done to you!” Involving the congregation in worship-centered
seminars and formalizing a congregational statement about worship are
also helpful practices, he noted.<br />
<br />
A time for questions and answers with both speakers followed the talks,
led by Brehm Center Academic Director Clayton Schmit. “However we
conduct our worship,” Schmit said in conclusion, “let us serve the One
who is worthy. Then we will be on the right track.” <br />

What is Worship?

From my days in seminary, through various pastoral settings, and now even following my graduate work in liturgy, a definition of worship I’ve found helpful is “to direct our attention and activity towards God.” Having recently reviewed Hotz and Matthews’ Shaping the Christian Life [“The Shaping of the Liturgy” in Call to Worship 41.1 (2007-2008)], I might alliteratively add “affection” as well, referring to both the more superficial “emotions” and the more formative affections in the sense employed by Hotz and Matthews (who borrow from Edwards). 

“Directing attention, affection, and activity towards God,” renders another trio (cf. Lester Ruth’s) of helpful questions for planning and evaluating worship. When our people leave worship, have they thought about, felt, and dedicated themselves to God’s interest in the world? Have they been inspired to love God with all their mind, heart, and strength in love for their neighbors? If not, have they worshiped the God of Christ? And if not, haven’t we failed as worship leaders? 

A further application of this definition extends beyond the ecclesial synaxis. Lending itself to a more sacramental or vocational perspective, we can routinely ask ourselves in our work, play, and leisure whether our attention, affection, or activity are directed towards God. If so, our entire lives are worship in the Romans 12:1 sense.

Excellent comments Tom and points well taken.
Beyond vocation, those are great questions to ask ourselves daily in each context.

BODY:
<p>As we've been living in the midst of house renovations, I've been thinking about congregational imagination. A congregation's imagination is reflected in many ways: how it shapes and reshapes its worship space, how it shapes its re-telling of biblical stories and its own congregational stories, the kinds of people who are welcomed and who feel at home, and the kinds of cultic practices it considers normative.&nbsp; </p>

<p>I had a pretty clear sense of the congregational imagination of the church in which I served as music director for over twenty years. The congregation had a sense of the dramatic, and this was reflected in its development of the worship space. It loved to take unusual angles in its retelling of biblical stories; it was not unusual to have worship feature a potter's wheel in the centre of the sanctuary and liturgical dance, though not frequent, was welcomed as part of normal (rather than “special” or “different”) worship. </p>

<p>I am now in a new congregation, and am still in the process of learning the scope of its imagination.</p>

<p>The congregation's imagination cannot, of course, be completely separated from that of its leadership. There is a kind of conversation that begins early in a pastor's (or other leader's) tenure, as congregation and pastor listen to one another, and develop what you might call an “image bank”, that treasure house of story, metaphor, symbol, visions and images with which it expresses its communal identity. </p>

<p>Dorothy Butler Bass, in “The Practicing Church” (Herndon Virginia: The Alban Institute, 2004) writes (p.5) that “…the pastoral imagination works in tandem with…the congregational imagnination, the imagination of God's people in community.”</p>

<p>
She says (p. 47) that “(f)or their entire history, Christians have invented, recreated or adapted traditions when old patterns no longer hold sway. Thus, fluid re-traditioning is an expression of the theological imagination, as biblical tradition is lived out in community, and is an ancient practice of faith that connects Christians to their ancestors.”</p>

<p>Part of what allows a congregation's imagination to develop is trust; trust between its leaders and the people, and among the members of the congregation. Trust is key, since imagination is a risky thing: it invites to see things differently, to try different ways of acting, and to be ready to see that God is “doing a new thing” in its midst. I have seen congregational imagination flourish and develop, becoming richer as it grows; I have also seen it shrink and wither as trust erodes and a congregation becomes fearful, wary weary, and finally unable to imagine its future or re-imagine its past.</p>

<p>One area of congregational imagination that fascinates me is how a congregation plays. In a way similar to watching a family at play in its own home (renovated or not!), how a community celebrates when it doffs its ceremonial or denominational garb is often the congregation at its most revealing.<br />

<p>Victoria Weinstein, a Unitarian Universalist minister [obviously outside of the bounds of evangelicalism] who goes by the handle 
PeaceBang, has launched a <a href="http://beautytipsforministers.blogspot.com/">fashion blog</a> to encourage the &quot;defrumpification of the 
American clergy.&quot; And in a recent <a target="_blank" href="http://www.boston.com/news/local/articles/2007/02/18/preaching_fashion/"><em>Boston Globe</em> story</a>, Weinstein says that even though fashion isn't the greatest 
concern for clergy, it still matters.</p>

<p>I read the article and I would like to put a spin on this.</p>
<p>Though Weinstein's advice is decent, especially to her target group of women 
ministers, her comments have implications. And I'm sure Weinstein's aim is not 
to cause any overt controversy, but it raises some interesting questions...one I've heard on more than one occasion.</p>
<p>&quot;<em>Anyone who is in a position of leadership has to consider what image they're

<p>Absolutely. But the underlying statement here is &quot;there is an accepted way to dress and if you don't dress that way, than you are projecting the wrong image.&quot;</p>
<p>What is the litmus test? Should there be? To me, the only 'test' is context. 
Consider your context and dress appropriately. If you minister in an urban area 
with neo-hippies, you may <em>need</em> to dress like you stepped out of 
1972.</p>
<p>And what version of 1972 does she mean? Frankly, the business casual look of 
the 80's &amp; 90's were the polyester suits of the 70's. But I guess by frumpy, 
she is not talking about that version of the 70's.</p>
<p>&quot;.<em>..the problem with frumpiness isn't so much aesthetic as it is a problem of 
looking as though you are not paying attention to the world and that you are not 
part of today's world.</em>&quot;</p>
<p>Maybe if you are dressing like a white collar business person for a 
twenty-something crowd. </p>
<p>The word 'frumpy' gets thrown around with the more casual look young people 
take. And again, in those contexts, they actually <em>are</em> paying attention 
to the world they live in.</p>
<p>Isn't dress a non-essential? And further, isn't a mandate on what dress is 
appropriate for worship extra-biblical [outside of the need for modesty]?</p>
<p>I see dress just like I see worship style. If the Bible does not forbid it, 
we have freedom to choose the best expression of it in our context as we honor 
the people in that context.</p>
<p>There seems to be an element of elitism related to the idea of one way to 
dress for worship. And frankly, for those that elevate it as a matter of 
contention, to me, it masks a deeper problem...they think that God cares about 
our outer appearance and that that appearance can hinder our worship of Him. </p>
<p>My friends, that is not the Gospel.&nbsp; God cares about our hearts not our habiliments... </p>

" God cares about our hearts not our habiliments. . ."

Well said Brad. You are absolutely right. Of course in that many U*Us are atheists they care not a whit about what God cares about.  

"And I’m sure Weinstein’s aim is not to cause any overt controversy. . ." 

Don’t be so sure of that Brad. Rev. Victoria Weinstein, aka Peacebang, has a bad habit of making outrageous statements that cause overt controversy. She deleted several of the more outrageous and controversial posts of her Peacebang "persona" just prior to the publication of the Boston Globe article. There are still a number of Peacebang posts that are  of a controversial nature. Like this one by oh so "Christian" U*U minister Rev. Victoria Weinstein. 

http://peacebang.blogspot.com/2005/01/please-pray-for-this-man.html

You might want to Google - Peacebang sodomy fantasy - to find evidence of a controverial post that she "memory holed" when the Boston Globe article was published. 

As Rev. Weinstein says, "Anyone who is in a position of leadership has to consider what image they’re projecting. . ."

Amazing timing! I am preparing for a message on 5/6/07 based upon Eph. 4:17-24, entitled: "The Makeover that really matters". It will be ironic in my congregation because I was the subject of a 'not-so-extreme makeover' sponsored by our Cincinnati Enquirer newspaper. I took lots of ribbing about it - but the truth of the matter is that while I do not feel 'frumpy' or terribly self-conscious about my clothes with people my age or older. I DO worry that my "mom-clothes" will be an obstacle for my younger hearers. I know those with whom I have a relationship will overlook my clothes (if I'm wearing something particularly 'old'), but, if the students or 20-somethings do not know me, I worry that they may disregard the message because my visual image may not connect with them/their world. My goal: get out of the way and let Christ speak...whatever it takes -

 As we plan weekly worship here at Fuller Seminary, the worship interns and I have been talking quite a bit lately about three persistent and related problems.</p>

<p>The
first problem is theologically inspired boredom: we are growing weary
of planning and leading the same twenty minutes of “opening exercises”
every week. The dominant feature of our pre-sermon worship time is a
significant chunk of music interspersed with words of welcome and
perhaps a prayer or two. In the past months we’ve worked hard at
intentionally selecting congregational songs that have cultural
breadth, theological depth, and liturgical clarity. Still, the
logistics of the service (including the architectural shape of our
space) leave us with a default organizational <span style="font-style: italic;">ordo</span>
with which we are increasingly uncomfortable. It is an order that feels
not blessedly simple but distressingly simplistic: songs (led by a
group from the right hand side), followed by a sermon (preached by a
professor from the left hand side).</p>

<p>The other problems we’re
struggling with are thematic coherence and sacramental expectation. </p>
-----
EXTENDED BODY:

<p>The
seminary professors who are asked to preach each week are notoriously
tardy in selecting the Scripture and theme for their sermons. Thus, the
chapel staff is left to plan the preparatory worship time (singing) with
no clue about what we’re preparing for. This is problematic because for
some in our worshiping community, the sermon is perceived as the
primary locus for encountering God. The musicians, then, feel this
burden: the music we sing must serve that encounter or risk total
irrelevance. Or something even worse.</p>
<p>For others in our
community, music itself has taken on sacramental qualities. For these
folks the primary means by which the gracious promises of God in Jesus
Christ are made tangible and real is in congregational song. Like it or
not, that is a lot of freight to haul with two guitars and three
chords. We are keenly feeling the need to find a better way to manage
expectations for meeting God in worship. </p>
<p>In response, we have begun to experiment with an alternative <span style="font-style: italic;">ordo</span> for our weekly gatherings.&nbsp; It is an arrangement that better reflects the history of campus-based worship,
and one for which sacramental expectations are spread out over a
broader palate of liturgical actions. What we are considering,
essentially, is abandoning the songs/sermon <span style="font-style: italic;">ordo</span>
in favor of a more complex, though no less mnemonic pattern. Rooted in
the structure of daily prayer followed for centuries by the precursors
of academics, the medieval monks, it has four parts rather than two:
praise/psalm/proclamation/prayer.</p>
<p>Services begin with an
acknowledgment of who God is, and the natural response to that
knowledge, praise. Of course, praise can be fittingly expressed in a
number of ways; music is just one of many options. The psalm and proclamation
follow. In them we are seeking neither scriptural ground for our
expressions of personal piety, nor applicatory fodder for individual
exercises of Christ-like devotion. Scripture isn’t a devotional
McNugget. Instead, we hope as a community in the Word to receive a
God’s-eye view of universal truth, a horizon-broadening articulation of
the world the way it really is: broadly broken, desperately beloved,
and radically redeemed. Finally, we focus on prayer as the place where
God and God’s people speak to one other, heart to heart. We do so, as
far as we are able, without preconditions and without pretense.</p>
<p>What
is so liberating about this structure is that music, along with every
other art form, becomes neither absolutely central nor peripheral to worship’s purpose. In our communal worship
, art is not inherent but instrumental. That is to say, both the band
and the liturgists retain their positions of leadership throughout the
entire service. Music—and for that matter, dance and graphic art and
drama and so on—are freed to serve the liturgical purposes of each
component part of the service: praise, psalm,proclamation , or prayer.
Songs of praise may be fitting, along with antiphonal psalms,
scriptural hymns, or musical prayers. Or none of the above. Or all.
Furthermore, the sacramental burden is shared by all the portions of
the service; any portion, in its own way, can help worshipers to
encounter the living and triune God.</p>

Hey Ron,

Another approach to skinning the liturgical cat of daily college chapel is the one we tried at Northwestern College (IA) while I was there: we stretched the liturgical action over the four days of chapel each week. Monday's pre-sermon time focused on praise, Tuesday on confession, Wednesday on the Psalms, Friday on benediction. 

This created some liturgical rhythm to the week that helped shape our thinking as we planned and helped shape a broader worship experience than welcome/songs/talk.

Peace,

Greg

If I were a blind person, I would be very offended by replacing the theological language of "sin" with "blindness."  Sure, the Bible uses blindness as a metaphor for sin (John 9, etc.), but it's one thing for Scripture to do it and another for us to uncritically appropriate such language into our liturgical life.

And think of how "bondage" is going to sound to the teenagers (chronologically or mentally) in the congregations.  "Admission of Bondage?"  Come on!

Marcus Borg is hardly the person worship planners who are committed to classic Christian faith should take a cue from.  Rather than finding all sorts of creative metaphors to replace traditional language of sin and forgiveness/pardon, why not try *teaching* people what these words mean?  You could use such metaphors as blindness, bondage, etc. to get the point across -- but the traditional language has served the church well for 2000+ years for a reason.

Mike,

Thanks for your comments -- they are well-taken, but I think the lesson here is that the traditional language of sin/salvation is, to many people, foreign or stale.  For them, some creative appropriation of secondary metaphors -- secondary <i>biblical</i> metaphors -- can enliven their understanding (and ours) of this central dynamic of faith.  

While one might object to blindness or bondage*, there are a whole host of other metaphors to employ in order to help a congregation understand sin and salvation.  So, for example, death and life.  Or injustice and justice.  Or disease and health.  Or chaos and  meaning.  The Borg prayers are fine examples of the sort of thing anyone might try with one of these other pairs.

* and actually, though the word "bondage" has those S&M overtones, it is very powerful for people who struggle with, or love someone struggling with, an addiction.  Depending on whose statistics you believe, that's up to 80% of your congregation.

Critiquing the thinking of Marcus Borg is often a risky thing to do. Critiquing that thinking when one has not read the book in question, nor the context in which quotes from it are taken, is perhaps even riskier. All sorts of misunderstandings are bound to occur and perhaps be worsened in the process.

Still, if Borg is making a case for an historical liturgical basis of a confession of sin and absolution sequence that has primarily to do with a confession of our situation before God over which we find ourselves with little control, but rather primarily as victims, I would argue that there are at least a good number of significant exceptions to that in early Christian liturgical practice, and indeed in the basic Ordo of most contemporary liturgical practice of Word and Table.

Consider Didache, for example. In Didache, the work of confession of sin does not appear to occur in the liturgy proper at all. Why? Because the underlying liturgical ethos and practice of this community appears to have been that acts of confession of sin to one another, and acts of reconciliation between parties that had offended against each other in some way, would have taken place before the liturgy proper began, and perhaps even in an entirely different space-- i.e., not in the context of worship at all. Why? Because there the approach was that in order to offer God a perfect sacrifice, without blemish or spot (Malachi is quoted to this point), the community has to be whole itself-- both in relationship to God (confession of sin/pardon) and in relationship to each other (acts of reconciliation). Persons who were not reconciled to each other, and who had not participated in the other confessional acts prior to the beginning of the liturgy simply would not have been admitted to the liturgy itself at all.

A similar impulse seems to inform the liturgical instructions in both Didascalia (AD 230) and its later recension as Apostolic Constitutions (AD 380). There, if the deacon has not called for persons who are not reconciled to each other to leave before the prayers of the people are offered, the entire rest of the liturgy is to be considered invalid. The point-- not so much that we have to get rid of people or fence the table (though that is exactly what is going on here!), but rather that God requires that those offering both prayers and the sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving in the Eucharist be as whole as possible-- both in their relationship to God and in their relationships with each other. 

One result of this approach is that when you look at the Eucharistic prayers themselves in these texts (Didache, Didascalia, Apostolic Constitutions), to which one might also add the Eucharistic prayers in Apostolic Tradition (early 3rd century, Rome or North Africa), you see an outpouring of thanksgiving for having been made worthy to offer thanksgiving and to share in the communion of Christ's body and blood (Didache doesn't mention either the death of Jesus or connect the bread and wine to body and blood directly-- but the same sense of thanksgiving for worthiness already granted is present). In other words, in all of these cases, the Eucharist is a feast of joy for deliverance in many forms, and for the opportunity to participate in the Divine Life-- it was not a feast from which one gains forgiveness or healing, but rather thanksgiving for those gifts already received. 

Coming back around to contemporary ecumenical Eucharistic liturgies. In Protestantism, particularly, the confession/pardon sequence has become rather a "moveable" rite. In some cases, especially in contexts where there is a Sunday service of the Word only, it is the first thing done out of the gates, as it were, as a means to allow any sort of act of worship to proceed. I would suggest that in such a context, indeed Borg's approach may well make sense. Such a confession of our condition makes sense as an entrance rite, corresponding to the Prayer for Purity in Rite II of the Book of Common Prayer (Almighty God, to whom all hearts are open, from whom no secrets are hid... etc.). I would say that such prayers and promises help us resituate ourselves as the baptized who are ever in need of repentance, precisely because we do live in a sinful world, and precisely because we are blinded and in bondage and need to be reminded of God's promise to open eyes and set us free. I would say that such prayers make sense for a setting such as daily office as well, and for similar reasons.

However, Rite II goes on to provide for a second rite of confession-- an explicit confession of sin and an act of forgiveness, as part of the sequence leading to the Lord's Table. The ritual of the United Methodist Church (Word and Table I and II) does precisely the same thing. Not having other books in front of me at the moment, I cannot comment how widespread this is-- but I would think it nearly universal. The point-- there is something important being taught in this dual pattern of confession. The first (collect for purity) confesses our state beyond our control. The second confesses our complicity in which we have acted, willingly or otherwise, to break relationships with God and neighbor. For the first there is no need of forgiveness-- but of healing, insight, or deliverance. For the second there is need of forgiveness. Why? So that we can do what comes next in the liturgy-- offer reconciliation to others with whom we have broken relationships (the Peace) and extend the blessing of forgiveness, reconciliation and peace to those with whom we are at peace, and thus, following the ancient pattern, be ready as a forgiven and reconciled people to offer ourselves and our gifts to God. 

If Borg's argument regarding the liturgical use of such "alternative" confessions is limited to a complementary role, at least in services of Word and Table, then at this point I'd find myself and the witness of early Christian liturgical practice to be generally with him. If, however, he's suggesting that we do not really need to confess the ways we've broken relationship and seek God's pardon, so that we can then offer pardon to others, especially in services of Word and Table, then I think he may be misreading or truncating what appears to be the larger witness of the tradition over time, as well as the liturgical witness of the practice of the Episcopal Church (among others) in its "dual" acts of confession. 

Of course, I'm open to the possibility that I may be truncating or misreading the liturgical traditions I've tried to represent here as well. 

Peace in Christ,

<p>Back in July of '06, I wrote an blog post entitled, &quot;<a href="http://relevintage.com/the-popes-rift-with-riffs/">The Pope's Rift with Riffs</a>&quot; on my blog, <a href="http://www.relevintage.com">relevintage.com</a>.</p>

<p>I would like to dust it off for the sake of conversation here on Worship Helps.&nbsp; Here it is:</p>

<p>It's official.&nbsp; The Pope has entered the worship wars.
</p>


<p>From the New York Sun this past week:</p><blockquote><p><span class="article_small" id="article">ROME - Pope
Benedict XVI has called for an end to electric guitars and modern music
being played in church and demanded a return to traditional choirs and
Gregorian chants.</span></p>
<p>The Catholic Church has been experimenting with new ways of holding
Mass to try to attract more people. The recital of Mass set to guitars
has grown in popularity in Italy; in Spain, Mass has been set to
flamenco music, and in America, the Electric Prunes produced a
“psychedelic” album called “Mass in F Minor.”</p>
<p>However, the use of guitars and tambourines has irked the pope, who
loves classical music. “It is possible to modernize holy music,” he
said at a concert conducted by the director of music at the Sistine
Chapel, Domenico Bartolucci. “But it should not happen outside the
traditional path of Gregorian chants or sacred polyphonic choral music.”</p>
<p>His comments prompted the newspaper La Stampa to compare him with
Pope Pius X, who denounced faddish classical and baroque compositions
and reinstated Gregorian chants in 1903.</p></blockquote><p>Uh oh.&nbsp; Get your camo on...</p><blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>As I have been in ministry and encountered with the idea that an
earlier musical form is a more Biblical form of worship, I can’t help
but feel like we are actually talking about something extra-Biblical.
In fact, it borders on elitism.
</p>

<p>Does the Pope really have scriptural grounds for his comments? Is he
saying that Gregorian chants are a more purer form of worship? Eh?</p>
<p>It is amazing to me that one will elevate one form of worship music
style over another, claiming it is more Biblically appropriate, when in
reality, it is just their preference [the article says the Pope ‘loves’
classical music].</p>
<p>Sorry Benedict, all musical styles are affiliated with some form of
cultural expression. Further, music has no inherent spiritual content.
In other words, it is amoral. Music is a message bearer. Lyrics are the
message.</p>
<p>Here is the rub. There are those of us who prescribe to the idea that it is Biblical to be missional to our culture [just read <a title="English Standard Version Bible" href="http://www.gnpcb.org/esv/search/?go=Go&amp;q=Acts+13">Acts 13</a> <a onclick="showhide('scripturizer866034094');" href="javascript://">[+/-]</a><span id="scripturizer866034094" style="border-style: dotted dotted dotted solid; border-color: blue; border-width: 1px 1px 1px 5px; padding: 10px; white-space: pre; display: none; color: black;">ERROR: You have exceeded your quota of 500 requests per day.

<p>But I don’t claim that it is a non-negotiable for everyone, depending on their context.</p>
<p>What I struggle with is those who have deemed that a certain musical form from a certain time is the <em>only </em>acceptable form within the context of corporate worship.</p>
<p>Now, can those who endorse contextual worship border on snobbery?
Yes. I am concerned that for the sake of being relevant, we diminish
the rich tapestry of all musical styles. So fellow contextualizers, in
defending the Bible’s liberties, we have to be careful not to fall into
the same elitist trap.</p>
<p>Here is the bottom line:&nbsp; Can’t we appreciate of the <em>many </em>diverse
musical styles that help individuals engage with God in worship? Can’t
we agree that different people respond differently to certain worship
styles? Can’t we affirm that we need the full breadth of worship
expressions within evangelicalism?</p>
<p>The issue of music styles falls into the category of a
non-essential. Let’s not condemn, globally, something that is against
our preferences!</p>
<p>Especially you Benedict!

Just one comment here... the notion that music itself is amoral may not be quite correct. Certainly you'd get a good argument about that from folks in ethnomusicology, neurophysiology, and, yes, a good number of ancient philosophers, Christian and non-Christian, east and west. 

I'm offering some broad strokes here, but ethnomusicologists would point to the role that different kinds of music play in specific cultures-- and that from a sheer socological perspective of "mores" and "folkways" that means that we're talking about "morality" as well. The wrong music or the wrong beat in the wrong place in many cultures would be understood as what we might call "sinful"-- an affront to the human and divine world.

Neurophysiologists (and some of the more savvy marketers!) would point out that certain types of musical tones, patterns and frequencies can influence choices that people will make about particular things-- and therefore also, in that sense, have claim to a kind of moral content. What they cannot measure (and the best of them usually claim to measure only in the context of their experimental data) is the degree to which those tones, patterns, and frequencies are culturally defined and to what degree they are hardwired, as it were. But in either case, if you're talking about choices, you are talking about morality.

And then a variety of philosophers of the ancient world, including Aristotle, have argued for specific aethestics regarding music as precisely moral concerns-- and one sees signs of those sorts of arguments throughout the history of music in the church as well-- whether it's an argument against polyphony, or for only triple meter, or against the "diabolus in musica" (the tri-tone interval) or at the Council of Trent whether music that is "troppo molle" (too complicated) ends up affecting not only the text, but also the souls of the hearers, and so the development  of homophonic polyphonic style for church music which lies behind the chorale and eventually the hymn tradition that has been so prevalent in Protestantism. 

I'm not trying to defend Benedict's dictum at this point-- only to note that it's hardly a given that music itself is or should be considered to be a-moral.

Peace in Christ,

Taylor Burton-Edwards

Wonderful response!  You have such a great handle on history, one that informs my view on the issue.  I have heard many of these arguments before but not so well stated.  

I think where I diverge from the ethnomusicologists, neurophysiologists, and, philosophers is they are talking about more aesthetics, not morality.

I would agree that music does have a certain aesthetic, especially depending on the cultural context.  But, it seems to me that in issues of morality in music, the cultural 'take' is imposed upon the music.  Any 'hard wiring' is imposed as well.  

I am taking music back to its basic form.  The notes and the combination of those notes have no inherent morality.  They just don't...aesthetics, yes, but morality, no.

I agree that its not a given that it is generally held that music is amoral, but I do think that it should be considered that it is.

Help me understand something.  When you say that when we are dealing with choices, we are dealing with morality, what do you mean?

Glad to continue the conversation!

I understand morality as a social construct, an agreed upon set of behaviors that are considered acceptable or even positively good and a set of warnings and consequences when behaviors considered unacceptable are performed. We're surrounded by many moralities all the time in US culture, since the cultures that form us here are very diverse. Some of these moralities, or moral structures, are more comprehensive than others. Others leave wide berth-- claiming some things commendable, others things reprehensible, and still others (or those it doesn't enumerate under the other two categories) as indifferent. US "popular" culture, broadly described, tends to leave very wide room for "things indifferent," and that would probably include music itself.

People make choices about all sorts of things all the time. And they do this always in the context of the morality structures that surround them or may have been internalized by them. Choices have moral value depending on the moral structure that is used to judge or evaluate them. 

Many Christian morality structures have generally tended to assume that every choice we make about anything is, to some degree, a moral choice, and so has to do with morality.  Christian theology, when it has dealt with aesthetics, has most often done so also from a moral/ethical perspective, and not as if aesthestics could or should be considered as having no particular moral content. Though aesthetics as a matter for theological contemplation has been rather neglected in Protestant discourse (perhaps the notable exception being in Anglicanism), I would hope that as Protestants do take this up again, we would do so with reference to the substantial body of Christian reflection, mostly Roman Catholic and Anglican, that has preceded us. 

Peace in Christ,

Hi Brad,

I think there are a few points you need to think about more thoroughly.

First of all, I think you may be putting words in the Pope's mouth. You quote the New York Sun's interpretation of what he said, but the only quote from the Pope himself seems to indicate that he was simply reiterating what Rome has always encouraged: modernization based on tradition. Chant, choirs and the organ have served the church well in the past. It seems reasonable to encourage their continued use and suggest that modern musicians build on this foundation. It didn’t sound like he was condemning all music but Rome’s historical repertoire—that would directly contradict Vatican II. I would be interested to read what the Pope said in its original context.

The New York Sun makes a connection between the Pope’s love of classical music and his statement on worship music, but the two may have little in common. It sounds to me that his statement is less about aesthetic preferences, and more about appropriateness for corporate worship. I think the Pope is mature enough to separate the two. He’s not the only one. A number of studies have shown, for example, that many young people who like pop music find it inappropriate for worship. So rather than enforcing a stylistic preference, he may be showing deep pastoral and theological wisdom. Not every music style is equally fitting for the context of worship. For example, if one of the primary goals of worship is communal singing, it would be silly to think that a 12-tone fugue would be an appropriate music style. In my estimation, one of the biggest issues facing the modern church is the difficulty of adapting pop music styles for worship. Pop music styles have developed as a medium for personal expression from an artist to an audience. There are only a handful of examples of “sing along” pop. So the Pope may be on to something.

Evangelicals have traditionally asserted that music is amoral, but I see some problems with this view. At best it elevates word arts over every other art, at its worst it says that music is meaningless. First of all, we need to consider what the Bible says about music. When David played his harp for Saul, it’s clear that something was happening on a spiritual level. There are a number of other places where the Bible affirms music without conveying that its worth is based on its ability to support words. Harold Best argues that words are more important than music because they convey meaning, but I’m with Jeremy Begbie in thinking that all the arts contribute to our understanding of the Word. Following Best’s philosophy to its logical end neuters music of anything more than a utilitarian role—it brings people in the door, it sells CDs, it warms up the crowd for the preacher. 

This is not to say that we can make absolute judgments about music. There are certainly cultural aesthetics at play in every musical decision. Those who ignore culture when assessing music, or make sweeping, universal judgments will always fall into aesthetic elitism. Perhaps even cultural racism. But there are theological and aesthetic issues that go deeper than specific cultural manifestations. Certainly the Bible should inform our worship theology in way that allows us to reject (or simply not adopt) our culture’s art forms when necessary. And we know from science that humans have certain musical universals hard-wired into our brains. (Higher sounds are more exciting, lower sounds move more slowly in comparison to higher, etc.) But these universal meanings will play themselves them out differently in each culture. Maybe we could agree that music is not amoral (meaningless), but also not universal (absolute meaning)?

These issues are important to me as a musician, but they’re important to all of us as worshipers. Churches have tended to gravitate towards the poles of cultural elitism or cultural relevancy without being tempered by opposing arguments. We’ll all benefit from thinking more deeply about the role of music in worship.

BODY:
<p>Back in Nov., I got an insightful email from a congregant about a phrase we sang in a song during our weekend church services.&nbsp; The song was &quot;Give Us Clean Hands&quot; by Charlie Hall.&nbsp; </p>

<p>See if you can find the phrase in question.&nbsp; Here are the lyrics:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Give Us Clean Hands</strong><br /><em>Charlie Hall</em></p>

<p><em><strong>Verse</strong></em><br />We bow our hearts we bend our knees<br />Oh Spirit come make us humble<br />We turn our eyes from evil things<br />Oh Lord we cast down our idols</p>

<p><em><strong>Chorus</strong></em><br />Give us clean hands give us pure hearts<br />Let us not lift our souls to another<br />Give us clean hands give us pure hearts<br />Let us not lift our souls to another<br />And oh God let us be a generation that seeks<br />That seeks Your face oh God of Jacob<br />And oh God let us be a generation that seeks<br />That seeks Your face oh God of Jacob</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 0.6em;">©2000 worshiptogether.com songs (Admin. by EMI Christian Music Publishing); sixsteps Music (Admin. by EMI Christian Music Publishing)</span> </p></blockquote><p>What was the phrase in question?</p>
-----
EXTENDED BODY:
<p>The answer is &quot;God of Jacob.&quot;&nbsp; My friend wanted to know what that meant.&nbsp; Here is what I said to him:</p><blockquote><p>Great
question!&nbsp; Quick history lesson:&nbsp; Jacob was the third Biblical
patriarch. His father was Isaac, and his grandfather was Abraham. 
Jacob, together with Esau, was born to Isaac and Rebeccah after 20
years of marriage, at which time his father was 60 (Genesis 25:26), and
Abraham was 160 years old. </p>

<p>During Rebeccah’s pregnancy, &quot;the children struggled together within
her&quot; (Genesis 25:22). Rebeccah questioned God about it and learned that
she was going to give birth to two children. They would become the
founders of two very different nations.&nbsp; Jacob would be the father of
the nation that God would bless, Israel.&nbsp; </p>

<p>The phrase “God of Jacob” is a type of technical phrase used as a
general designation of the God of the patriarchs [as mentioned before:
Abraham, Isaac, Jacob]. Some references speak of the “God of my [your,
thy, his, their] father” without mention of a particular father, while
other references include the name of a particular patriarch [i.e. God
of Jacob]. So the Bible uses the formula to emphasize continuity
between the God who is revealed to Moses and the God who guided the
patriarchs. </p>

<p>It is important to note that under the new covenant, in the New
Testament, this formula is transformed to mark the continuity between
historic Israel and Christianity [that’s us]. The God revealed in Jesus
Christ is the same as the God revealed to the patriarchs.&nbsp; The promises
made to Abraham established the concept of a people descended through
Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, who would be in a special historical and
spiritual relationship with God. </p>

<p>So in the song, when we sing “God of Jacob” we are recognizing that
we are from a long line of descendants that have a special historical
and spiritual relationship with God.&nbsp; It’s pretty powerful!</p>

<p>I hope that makes sense.&nbsp; Thanks for probing...</p></blockquote><p>Upon
reflecting on this answer recently, I realized that there is a
follow-up question that begs to be asked.&nbsp; Is it beneficial to sing
songs with phrases that need that much explanation?&nbsp; Don't we want
songs to be more accessible?&nbsp; </p>

<p>Well, yes and no.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Yes, we want songs to be accessible.&nbsp; The idea of corporate worship
is that a local body of Christ-followers can come and worship
together.&nbsp; Most congregants aren't musicians, so it is important that
most songs [note most] are memorable, in good keys, don't extend the
vocal range too much, and are easy to learn on the first listen.</p>

<p>But no, if accessibility is the only criteria by which we choose
worship material.&nbsp; Of course it depends on how you define
accessibility.&nbsp; </p>

<p>As I mentioned before, melodic accessibility is very important. 
That is where good keys, melodic range, etc. comes into play. But what
about lyrical accessibility?&nbsp; </p>

<p>I grew up in a traditional Southern Baptist church in the 70's and
80's.&nbsp; We sang from the hymnal.&nbsp; Fanny Crosby was our musical hero. 
Albiet there was a thing called the Jesus Movement happening on the
left coast that would influence the worship music landscape in the near
future, most of America in the 80's were singing &quot;Blessed Assurance&quot;
with a piano and organ [unless you were in the Church of
Christ...acapella only].&nbsp; All of this is to say that lyrical
accessibility was not considered much because it was accepted that
those who came to worship God were believers and could understand the
theological depth of the text.</p>

<p>In the 80's and 90's, lyrical accessibility became a high priority. 
Since there was a high premium on engaging the seeker, worship leaders
everywhere combed through lyrics to make sure there wasn't a term or
phrase that could confuse.&nbsp; And I think worship songwriters noticed
this trend and wrote to that end.&nbsp; &nbsp; Sadly, much of the worship music
from this period will not endure because it erred on the side of 'safe.'</p>

<p>But here in the 2000's, there is a growing [and promising] trend
that I have noticed within the worship music spectrum related to this
issue.&nbsp; Progressive mainstream worship songwriters like Matt Redman,
Charlie Hall, Brenton Brown, etc. have alot of depth to their lyrics. 
The reason I say mainstream is three-fold: 1) under-the-radar people
like the folks at Indelible Grace have been doing this type of thing
for some time now and 2) if more mainstream writers are moving in this
direction, it signals a shift in what is acceptable and accessible in
lyrical content and 3) younger generations are more tolerable of
broader lyrical content. </p>

<p>So practically speaking, I think in the area of lyrical
accessibility, it is important to have a balance of those songs that
say one thing very simply, those that are deeper in nature
[particularly theologically-which includes updated hymns], and then
songs that marry both.&nbsp; </p>

<p>One of the best examples of the latter is Tomlin's &quot;How Great is Our
God.&quot;&nbsp; The verses of &quot;How Great...&quot; are some of the richest 'hymnlike'
lyrics I've seen in a while [&quot;The splendor of the King, robed in
majesty...] but the chorus is the repetitive and very accessible title
of the song.</p>

<p>As for songs that have more depth, one of the benefits, as seen in
my interchange with one of our congregants, was it challenged him to
not just sing words he didn't understand, but to seek more
understanding after the worship service.&nbsp; And I know what your next
thought is and no, I don't think this he is the exception.&nbsp; </p>

<p>My impression is that our congregants [and seekers for that matter]
are smarter and more sophisticated than we make them out to be.&nbsp; That
is why I think we need to embrace the shift in lyrical accessibility to
include deeper content.</p>

<p>Here is the irony to me.&nbsp; For example, it is known that hymns, or
theology set to music, have long been a vehicle for learning the deeper
things of God.&nbsp; Isn't that what worship is about?&nbsp; Jumping headfirst
into the mystery and beauty of God?&nbsp; Yet, we have waffled on the issue
of lyrical accessibility for almost two decades.&nbsp; And honestly, the
depth of our worship is malnourished.&nbsp; </p>

<p>So back to the follow-up question: is it beneficial to sing songs
with phrases that need explanation?&nbsp; The answer is yes.&nbsp; If it is kept
in balance, there is nothing wrong with singing the phrase 'God of
Jacob.'&nbsp; </p>

<p>In fact, it just might engage church-goers into a deeper worship experience!</p>

Brad,

Thanks for this post.  I've used this song before, and like it a lot, especially for services that are dealing with issues of idolatry.  

Two comments: First, you helpfully give some of the background to a phrase like "God of Jacob."  Of course, its origin was in an exclusively patriarchal culture, and so I'll often use a balancing phrase elsewhere in the service to remind congregants that our God is God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, but also Sarah, Rebecca, and Rachel.

Second, I also like the phrase "God of Jacob" so well because of all the Patriarchs, I find Jacob the most deeply flawed and hence the most like me.  He had many good qualities, but he was a liar, a cheat, and didn't let scruples interfere with his ambition.  Just the same, look what God was able to do with him!  If God can speak powerfully to him and through him, there's a chance that I, too, can be a useful tool in the hands of the "God of Jacob."

BODY:
<p>I listened to a number of CCM artists recently for an article I was writing for <em><a href="www.hymnsociety.org">The Hymn</a></em>, and what surprised me was how often they quoted the words of well-known hymns. Jars of Clay, Kirk Franklin, Selah, DC Talk, Newsboys, all slip easily from pop vernacular into the heightened language taken directly from Isaac Watts, Charles Wesley or Fanny Crosby. </p>

<p>At first, I found it odd, even though I knew the work of some of them. Where does this come from? Isn't the idea of “contemporary” music to be, well, contemporary? Aren't contemporary artists supposed to be exploring a contemporary language of worship along with the contemporary musical idiom they are exploring? </p>
-----
EXTENDED BODY:
<p>There's a cynical take on this. CCM artists are putting out hymn “product” In the same way that any commercial act will produce a Christmas album. Let's face it: Christmas piety sells. A Christian audience responds, at least in part, to the familiar cadences of traditional hymnody.</p>

<p>But the cynical take will only take us so far. For one thing, there is a huge segment of the Christian church for whom hymns have no nostalgic connection. They were raised on contemporary pop music on their car radio, CCM on their CD players, with praise and worship music forming a large part of their worship.</p>

<p>It could be partly the depth and resonance that history brings. The words of historic hymn writers have survived the test of time. If you want a quick lesson on what that test means, look at an old hymnal at the hundreds of hymns. They are full of words that you could never sing today without wincing, groaning or laughing out loud. The hymns that have survived this test offer more than re-assurance and stability. In fact they are as full of the recognition of uncertainty, struggle and pain as they are of steadfast assurance. What they do is to give us perspective on our own agonies, and let us know that others have faced them before us. The cloud of witnesses still bears witness.</p>

<p>But I think there remains a hunger that, successful as it is, contemporary music has not been able to satisfy. That is the hunger for common song - for lack of a better word, congregational song.</p>

<p>At the time I was listening to CCM artists, I watched the documentary “Bob Dylan: No Direction Home.” I was amazed to watch everyone singing. And not doing live karaoke during a concert, when the lead singer pointed the mike at the audience, but sitting around actually singing a song from beginning to end. It felt very much like a worship service, secular perhaps, but still able to inspire, encourage and offer vision for that generation.</p>

<p>And how strange it seemed, how anachronistic. I have little nostalgia for the supposed good-old days of the sixties, but I found it interesting that the generation noted for its activism on the public front was also active in its group singing. Could it be that the two are connected. Could it be that if we are spectators in our worship, we might be also be spectators in our lives?</p>

<p>Hymns continue to attract us with great power, whether we are ordinary singers, or performers. Even when the sound system has been switched off, and the spotlights packed away, we can still sing a hymn together. Hymn (like folk songs) depend, not on the personalities of performers, but on our ordinary voices to bring them to life. But once we do, they offer a unique power to transform. </p>

<p>What do you think?</p>

If you follow the lectionary readings for this season you will find that they are accounts of prophets proclaiming the coming of God’s kingdom and anticipation of the coming of the messiah. We re-live this anticipation through these texts, our music, and even the way creation enters more deeply into darkness until the passing of the winter solstice. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span face="Times New Roman">The Advent wreath has its roots in northern European pre-Christian practices where people sought the return of the sun in the darkest time of the year (at the winter solstice) by lighting candles and fires. By the middle ages, Christians used fire and light to represent Christ's coming into the world. Using this same symbolism, the Advent wreath developed a few centuries ago in Germany. The advent wreath signifies waiting and hopeful expectation, looking forward to both Christ’s birth and to Christ’s coming again at the end of time. The circular shape of the wreath represents eternal life. The evergreens signify the faithfulness of God and the lighted candles reminder us of the light of Christ in the world.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span face="Times New Roman"><strong>Making an Advent Wreath</strong></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span face="Times New Roman">Symbols of God's promise of life speak clearest when they are drawn directly from our daily experience and environment. Use natural materials to make a wreath such as evergreens, holly, laurel, or other green shrubs which retain their freshness. The size of the Advent wreath should be appropriate to the size of the worship space. The wreath should not draw attention away from the font, table, or ambo (pulpit), but it should be large enough to make a strong statement about the meaning of the season. It may be hung or placed on a table or stand.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span face="Times New Roman"><strong>Candles</strong></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span face="Times New Roman">There is no prescribed color for the candles. Four natural colored candles are always appropriate and symbolize the light for which we wait. Four deep purple candles, a sign of the penitential nature sometimes attributed to the season, may be appropriate. Congregations that use blue (symbolizing hope) as the liturgical color during Advent would be consistent to use blue candles. The older practice using a pink candle on the third Sunday in Advent is no longer consistent with current lectionaries.</span></p>

On Thanksgiving Day many churches offer a very traditional worship service: Psalm 100, a litany of thanksgiving, “Come, You Thankful People, Come.” On a day when we look back with gratitude at God’s good gifts to us, it makes sense to make use of the work and wisdom of our forebears and to worship using that which is tried and true. Other congregations seek innovation: pilgrim puppets behind the pulpit, prayers of thanks colored (not written) in crayon on scraps of paper and dropped in the offering plate.</p>

<p>Our culture craves novelty, which may explain—but doesn’t necessarily commend—our thirst for it. A more laudable urge is to offer in our worship not a stale tradition, repeated out of habit, but something original: our creative expression, our prayers and words and music, our very selves. We want to offer something fresh and new. But must it be an either/or choice?&nbsp; Many congregations are very successful in their efforts to examine the tried and true traditions (often more true than actually tried), identify the best in them, and then freshen them in ways sensitive to their contexts.&nbsp; Here are a few ideas...</p>
-----
EXTENDED BODY:
<p><strong>Call to Worship

</strong><br />Psalm 100 is just the right Scripture to use as a call to worship on Thanksgiving Day. It’s familiar, and it summons God’s people both to worship and to give thanks. But the elevated diction of most psalm translations, and the formal quiet out of which calls to worship are often spoken, can diminish the psalm’s affective energy. To generate enthusiasm, some congregations bring out their best thespian/liturgist to lead the reading with strong voice and grand gesture. But the right song might work as well—if not better—to encourage rather than coerce the congregation into eager, participative praise. For example, teach and then sing the song “Come, All You People” (it can be found in the hymnal supplement <em><a href="https://www.faithaliveresources.org/Products/400200/sing-a-new-creation-songbook.aspx">Sing! A New Creation</a></em>) at the very start of the service, and let the energy leak into the responsive reading of Psalm 100 as a call to worship. Let it leak by maintaining a soft percussive pulse, and maybe a low bass drone, throughout the speaking. Then reprise the song afterward, and the service will have begun with faithfulness and vigor.&nbsp; (See the music <a href="http://www.cymorthcristnogol.org/addoli/caw06/CAW06%20Act%20of%20Worship%20erratum%20music%20insert.pdf#search=%22%22come%20all%20you%20people%22%22">here</a>, hear it <a href="http://www.dogpile.com/info.dogpl/clickit/search?r_aid=2679264FAC7743AB9D8226E257697030&amp;r_eop=3&amp;r_sacop=3&amp;r_spf=0&amp;r_cop=main-title&amp;r_snpp=3&amp;r_spp=0&amp;qqn=5%40%2BeS3%24%40&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;r_coid=372372&amp;rawto=http://www.giamusic.com/sacred_music/audio/UyaiMo.ram">here</a>.)

</p>

<p><strong>Hymn of Thanks and Praise

</strong><br />Nearly every hymnal has its share of wonderful Thanksgiving songs. “<a href="https://hymnary.org/text/come_ye_thankful_people_come">Come, You Thankful People, Come</a>”—despite the agricultural metaphor’s diminishing resonance with most congregations—is just one of them. Along with “<a href="http://www.cgmusic.com/cghymnal/others/letallthings.htm">Now Thank We All Our God</a>” and “<a href="https://hymnary.org/text/we_gather_together_to_ask_the_lords">We Gather Together</a>,” these tried and true texts are rich in theology and poetry. But older songs have no monopoly on depth. “Have We Any Gift Worth Giving” (SNC 14) is a superb contemporary hymn text by Carl Daw, based on Romans 12:1. The musical setting by Al Fedak is contemporary, but in the familiar style of a Genevan psalm tune.

</p>

<p>A recently freshened favorite I’ve heard is “<a href="http://www.cgmusic.com/cghymnal/others/letallthings.htm">Let All Things Now Living</a>.”&nbsp; A shift in time signature from 3/4 to 4/4 (each q becomes q.) gives the song a sense of uplift, and at a decent tempo (132 bpm), the syncopation gives it the urgency of folks traveling—even running—onward, with joy, from “light into light.” Add the descant on the second stanza, but drop all accompaniment to let the congregation soar on “We too should be voicing . . .” Then add support again at “Till all things now living unite in thanksgiving . . .”

</p>

<p>Sometimes new songs need freshening too. <a href="http://www.typepad.com/t/app/control/files?__mode=show_link&amp;file=GiveThanks.pdf">Here</a> is the contemporary favorite “Give Thanks,” arranged here by Daniel Richardson in a simple jazz style. An ensemble with even modest chops can pull this off gracefully. Use a bass for the lowest line (derived from the chord chart), and a soprano instrument on the melody. <a onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=800,height=652,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false" href="http://worshiphelps.blogs.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/givethanks.gif"><img width="160" height="130" border="0" src="http://worshiphelps.blogs.com/worship_helps/images/givethanks.gif" title="Givethanks" alt="Givethanks" style="margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px; float: left;" /></a>A vocalist or soprano instrument might also lead the congregation if they will sing along—but it might be difficult; the melody contributes some of the most “jazzy” notes (the flat and sharp 9s and 13s), and there is the unusual F# in measure 14. With the highs and lows taken care of, the rhythm instrument (piano or guitar) can concentrate on the more unfamiliar chord forms. Note that each measure usually gets two chords—but they’re not equal. The second chord, when on the fourth beat, is a “passing” chord.

</p>

<p><strong>Litany of Thanksgiving

</strong><br />The tried and true litany of thanksgiving is almost always responsive. It engages leaders and the congregation in a rhythmic back-and-forth that is, at its best, almost musical. But at its worst, the carefully crafted words of the leader are punctuated by the rote and lifeless repetition of a simple 
&nbsp; &nbsp; phrase, prompting an unfortunate congregational response: boredom. One remedy is to allow the congregational response to be not nearly musical but undeniably musical. A sung refrain can freshen even the dullest litany and bring new life to a psalm. For examples, look at the “Thanksgiving” section in <em>Sing! A New Creation</em>. It sets three Psalms of Thanks to different musical responses. One is based on a classic hymn (Psalm 107 and “Now Thank We All Our God”), one on a global song (Psalm 66 with “Cantad al Señor”), and one on a praise song (Psalm 65 with “Shout to the Lord”).

</p>

<p>The second feature of the tried and true litany is its poetry. It employs elegant language, an offering to God of the best words we can wield. But too much of a good thing can become tedious; we’ve all endured the litany composed by the congregation’s erstwhile (and infrequently indulged) poet—the litany that seems to go on and on and on, in language less evocative than exhaustive. As in music, less is more. The best poetry is concrete and vivid, pointing to the universal by means of the specific. Children are surprisingly good at describing the world in observant detail. So in the weeks preceding Thanksgiving, ask your own congregation’s young people to help assemble the raw materials for a unique Thanksgiving litany. Offer them some broad categories of things for which we’re grateful to God:&nbsp; 
created beauty, comforts of home, blessings of faith, and so on. Let them 
&nbsp; &nbsp; work at home or in a Sunday school class compiling their own lists.&nbsp; Encourage them to strive for descriptive detail (“pesky little brothers and wise grandmothers” is more memorable and meaningful than “our loving families”). But beware language that’s clever but quirky or hard for a congregation to read (“<a href="http://mindprod.com/contact/loves.html">skies of couple color as a brindled cow</a>” 
wouldn’t work well in worship). 

<a onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=577,height=206,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false" href="http://worshiphelps.blogs.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/givethankslitany_1.gif"><img width="320" height="114" border="0" src="http://worshiphelps.blogs.com/worship_helps/images/givethankslitany_1.gif" title="Givethankslitany_1" alt="Givethankslitany_1" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;" /></a>Then have someone with a flair for words knit them together for the Thanksgiving Day service. Keep the syntactical units short, the sentence structures simple. A good example of this sort of litany (complete with sung response) is “<a href="https://www.reformedworship.org/article/september-2001/give-thanks-god-all-earth-litany-thanksgiving">Give Thanks to God, All the Earth</a>.” It has been revised many times with the help of young poets. 



</p>

<p><strong>Prayer of Thanksgiving

</strong><br />A good prayer of thanksgiving has much in common with a good litany. It is poetic in both rhythm and diction, it is reverent and engaging, and it is often led by a practiced public prayer. Its theme is thanksgiving rather than thanks-getting; it recalls the needs of others around the world and God’s blessings showered on all people rather than voicing appreciation for the goods, services, and luxuries we are fond of.

What would it take to transform a good prayer of thanksgiving into a great prayer of thanksgiving? Perhaps the right liturgical context: communion. The Lord’s Supper liturgy includes a large section often named the “Great Prayer of Thanksgiving.” It is a recollection of God’s gift of salvation offered in Jesus Christ, a joining with all creation blessing God as good and holy and the source of all blessing. In fact, the term “Eucharist” means “thanksgiving.” This, after all, is what Thanksgiving traditions—whether liturgical or cultural—are all about: gathering around a table with loved ones to have a meal of gratitude, remembrance, community, and hope. What better way to give a tried and true tradition fresh, new life? </p>

What should Christians do when we gather to worship?&nbsp; &nbsp;Of course, there are all sorts of things we actually do: we
stand, we sit, we sing, we raise our hands, we are silent, we eat and
drink, we pray.&nbsp; Then again, we do all these things when we attend a
football game.&nbsp; But in worship we do all these things (and many
more) with worshipful purposes in mind: to confess, to praise, to hear the Word, etc.&nbsp; But we don't do every possible option at every single service.&nbsp; So what elements are so important that we should not do without them?</p>

<p>The Bible offers many examples of the sorts of things worshippers do when they assemble:&nbsp; the Old Testament records in great detail what Temple worship was supposed to look like, including the specifics of animal and agricultural sacrifices.&nbsp; The gospel of Luke tells of reading from the scriptures as part of synogogue worship.&nbsp; Acts 2 tells us that the early church devoted itself to the &quot;apostles' teaching and fellowship, to the breaking of bread and the prayers.&quot;&nbsp; So my question is this:&nbsp; what are the non-negotiables of worship?&nbsp; When God's people gather, by the power of the Holy Spirit, to renew the convenant of grace in Christ Jesus, what stuff do we do?&nbsp; What actions do we perform that are non-negotiable?&nbsp; If we gather to worship and never hear a sermon, is it worship?&nbsp; If we don't break bread at the table, have we worshipped?&nbsp; If we don't pray., or sing...&nbsp; You get the idea.&nbsp; What do you think?&nbsp; Post your comments.</p>

Or, you can purchase this book from <a href="http://www.ltp.org/" rel="nofollow">Liturgy Training Publications</a>. A few weeks before All Saints Day, place the book in the church and invite people to write the names of loved ones they wish to remember. Read the names aloud during the distribution of communion at your All Saints Day service. This ritual reminds us that one aspect of the Lord's Supper is the communion with all the saints. When we eat and drink, we dine with our loved ones and all the saints who have gone before us. Instead of reading the names during communion distribution, you could included the names in the prayers or read them at the font in connection with baptismal remembrance.</p>

Each year we come to the end of October and the planning calendar reminds us that “Daylight Savings Time ends”! But more importantly the calendar will also remind us that the last Sunday in October is “Reformation Sunday”. However, a closer look will reveal that October 31 is “Reformation Day” (not Halloween on the Church calendar) and November 1<sup>st</sup> is “All Saints’ Day”. What is a church to celebrate? This year “Reformation Sunday is October 29<sup>th</sup>” and the next Sunday is not All Saints but “Christian and Citizen” Sunday. Of course, in a perfect world, we would celebrate the Reformation on October 31<sup>st</sup> and All Saints on November 1<sup>st</sup>. However, it is not always easy to get people to come to church during the week (as we observe during Holy Week). I admit, Christmas is an exception, but then again even the culture has consumed this holiday!</p>

EXTENDED BODY:
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span face="Times New Roman">During the period of the church calendar between Trinity Sunday and Christ the King, All Saints is our only feast day. It is also the time of the year when the harvest is beginning in the northern hemisphere. During the harvest images of abundance and feasting begin to appear. This is also the time when we celebrate those who have completed their baptism (those who have died) and celebrate with joy the communion of saints with whom we raise our voices in song at the Lord’s Table each communion (…we raise our voices with the choirs of angels and the faithful of every time and place who forever sing to the glory of Your name... –<em>Great Prayer of Thanksgiving)</em>. The feast of All Saints reminds us that our baptism is a life-long journey and that we are joined with those who have completed their baptism (died in the faith) in the mystery of the sacrament of communion. And this is a foretaste of that ultimate banquet feast to come! When the ultimate harvest is complete! Baptism and Eucharist are the primary symbols of this feast day. The symbols of water, wine and bread should be present and engaged each Sunday. However, on this day we celebrate how they join us as one community across time and space. We are reminded that nothing in life or in death can separate us from the love of God in Christ. It is through baptism that we enter the church and only in death is our baptism complete. At the table we are joined with Christ, one another and the faithful of every time and place.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span face="Times New Roman"><br /></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span face="Times New Roman">One of the key changes sought after by the Reformers was a reclaiming of sacramental practice that involved the gathered community of faith. Giving communion back to the people and making baptism an act done in public with the congregation were important pieces of the Reformation. In a time when our church is also reclaiming a more frequent sacramental practice, the celebration of Reformation Sunday as also a the Feast Day of All Saints may be a powerful way to celebrate and connect baptism and the Lord’s Supper. In <em><a href="http://pcusa.org/theologyandworship/pubs/calltoworship.htm">Call to Worship</a>, Year B, vol. 39.1</em>, there are liturgical resources for each Sunday as well as feast days. There is two pages dedicated to <em>All Saints’ Day</em> (pp.198-199) that can be helpful in constructing an All Saints’/Reformation Sunday. Also the <em><a href="https://www.presbyterianmission.org/ministries/worship/christianyear/all-saints-day/">Book of Common Worship</a>, p.385-391, </em>is dedicated to this Feast Day of All Saints’. If you are not planning a special Feast Day celebration on November 1<sup>st</sup> then you may consider using this material to celebrate All Saints’ as well as Reformation Sunday this year. </span></p>

<p>A guest minister who came to preach at our church told me that, during the “children's time”, he planned to sing one of his own songs with the children. So, he brought his guitar and taught them a song whose chorus went something like this:</p>

<p>Bugs, bugs, bugs, bugs,<br />
Bugs, bugs, bugs, bugs.</p>

<p>I forget what the song was about: it may have had something to do with Noah and the Ark, but the kids sang willingly enough, and trooped off to Sunday School. But it made me both wince and wonder.<br />
I winced because the guest minister pitched the song far too low for their voices, choosing a comfortable key for the guitar (C major) that had them straining to sing an F below middle C. </p>

<p>Therefore, if you are a guitar player, start with the children's range before you choose the key, rather than the other way round. Typically children's lowest note is the G below middle C (the open third string on the guitar). Make sure the song uses that note very little; middle C is much better as a low note. For practical purposes, children's high note is somewhere between C an octave above (first string, 8th fret), and E a third above that. Of course, children can sing higher, but I am here writing about congregational singing, not practiced choral (or solo) singing.</p>

<p>
	I wondered at how eager children are to learn and to be challenged, and how little that song offered them in the way of musical nourishment. Surprisingly, the songs that children latch onto and make their own, are often very different from what we might expect as a “children's” song. Anyone who has worked on the editorial committee for a hymn collection knows how elusive are the qualities that make a good children's song or hymn.</p>

<p>
Rather than looking at the “genre” of the song, I wonder if it might be better to ask some of these questions: how would a 3-year old hear this song? A 6 hear old, a 10-year old? How many “doors” does it offer a child to enter by: concrete imagery? possibilities for motion and actions? sensory details? repeatable sections or phrases? Will it allow a conversation, a question and answer, a call and response between children, the leader and the choir or praise band? (Stuart Townend's “Who Paints the Skies?” is a song that allows this kind of worship conversation to happen. “All creatures of our God and King” - or any hymn that has a repeating “Alleluia” could serve as a wonderful kind of dialogue, if the congregation sang all the words, including “Oh, Praise Him” and the children sing the “Alleluia.” I should say that I haven't done this yet; when I do, I'll let you know how it went, and what pitfalls to avoid. I will probably teach the final “Alleluia” with its 3-beat penultimate note first!</p>

<p>
I will continue to share lessons learned and insights gleaned from the front (and back) pews of congregational song, but in my next post I hope to report on some experiences in summer music and worship festivals around the continent. <br />

</strong>Dr. Steven Taylor is the founding pastor of Graceway Baptist Church in Ellerslie, New Zealand. He has a PhD on the Emerging Church and a Masters in Theology in communicating the cross in a postmodern world. Steve recently did a course at Fuller Seminary entitled “Communicating the Biblical Text in a PostModern Culture” in July. </p>



<p>He argues that to communicate the biblical text for today’s context requires one to “incarnate, indwell, our culture.”&nbsp; Taylor goes on to use the phrase “DJing” with respect to the community.&nbsp; A record DJ learns the historical stories (old records) and uses them authentically in contemporary culture and integrates them into the community's stories.&nbsp; There is too much to summarize here, but do look for his book “<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0310259045/sr=8-1/qid=1155843286/ref=sr_1_1/002-0739142-4980844?ie=UTF8">The Out of Bounds Church: Learning to Create a Community of Faith in a Culture of Change</a>” from Zondervan.</p>

<p>Taylor cites Bono of U2 as a person who effectively DJs today.&nbsp; According to Taylor, Bono is in fact a worship leader for over 40,000 people; Bono recontextualizes the biblical text and leads concert goers into a time of community worship and prayer. Taylor plays the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000BNXDE6/sr=8-1/qid=1155843384/ref=pd_bbs_1/002-0739142-4980844?ie=UTF8">“Vertigo ‘05” DVD</a> and shows us how Bono is leading worship.&nbsp; This intrigued me to the point that&nbsp; Dr. Taylor and I discussed this further after the workshop. The following is from Steve’s article <a href="mailto:www.emergentkiwi.org.nz/archives/7_things_i_learnt_from_bono_about_worship_leading.php">“7 Things I learnt from Bono about Worship Leading.” </a> </p>

<p><strong>1.&nbsp; &nbsp; Connect uniquely.</strong> In the Vertigo DVD, Bono speaks about Chicago and his memories of Chicago. He makes a unique connection with context, day, and time.<br /><strong>2.&nbsp; &nbsp; Engage through familiarity.</strong> Bono includes songs that resonate with previous experiences and previous encounters.<br /><strong>3.&nbsp; &nbsp; Use repetition to call forth prayer.</strong> Bono uses the repetitive “Hallelujah.” It is easy to sing. The simple repetition enables the audience to sing with the band.<br /><strong>4.&nbsp; &nbsp; Secure a 5th (visual) band member. </strong>U2 now has a 5th member of the band to add a visual layer to the experience. A wise worship leader will look to add not just singers or musicians, but a “visual” person to their team.<br /><strong>5.&nbsp; &nbsp; Create hope by drawing the best from the past.</strong> Bono tells the audience in the Vertigo DVD, “We as a band are looking to the future. We’re taking the best of the past and moving forward with hope.”<br /><strong>6.&nbsp; &nbsp; Plan participation. </strong>Bono can draw one boy from the audience to sing to, one woman from the audience to dance with. He uses repetition to call forth prayer and encourage congregational singing.<br /><strong>7.&nbsp; &nbsp; Invoke passionate practices.</strong> Bono invites the audience to hall out their cell phones and to text “Make Poverty History campaign.”&nbsp; A worship leader turns singing into action. He turns entertainment into justice.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span face="Times New Roman">Ron’s story about baptizing his nephew and the connections of baptism to our care for creation show how multifaceted the layers of this sacrament are. All of life, for those of us born of water and the Spirit, is wet. In other words, every moment of each day is grounded in baptism. Even if we are not following the will of God, those moments are redeemed in God’s grace, which is one aspect of baptism (cleansing from or forgiveness of sin). This is why confession or at least a reflection on how we “missed the mark” or sinned is a part of the compline prayer. The ancient “compline” prayer, or prayer at the close of the day shapes our sleeping and rising in the death and resurrection of Christ. This image is one of baptismal life; continually dying (repenting and turning from ways that separate us from Christ) and rising to new life each day.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span face="Times New Roman"><br /> </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span face="Times New Roman">Throughout the worship service there are several moments each Sunday where we can engage water in ways that help us understand and live more deeply into our baptism. Here are a few examples:</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span face="Times New Roman"><br /> </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span face="Times New Roman"><strong>During the gathering of the people</strong> you can pour water into the font or baptismal pool with words that accentuate our inclusion into the family of God such as: </span></p>

<blockquote><p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span face="Times New Roman"><em>You are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, God’s own people, in order that you m ay proclaim the mighty acts of the One who called you out of darkness into God’s marvelous light</em><span style="font-style: normal;">. (1 Peter 2:9)</span></span></p></blockquote>

<p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span face="Times New Roman"><strong>After confession</strong>, you may pour or splash water while you while declaring God’s grace and forgiveness. Any words of forgiveness and grace accentuate baptism. However, you may use words that are more explicit:</span></p>

<blockquote><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span face="Times New Roman"><em>Do you not know that all of us who have been baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death? Therefore we have been buried with him by baptism into death, so that, just as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, so we too might walk in newness of life. </em>(Romans 6:3,4)<em> Know that you are forgiven and be at peace, walking in the light of Christ, loving God with all your being and loving your neighbor as yourself.</em></span></p></blockquote>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span face="Times New Roman"><strong>Calling for the offering </strong>is a great place to remind people of the promises they have made at baptism. We promise to follow Christ, obey his word, love God and one another and live our lives in ways that show Christ’s love in this world. Our best offering is the way we live. While money is important, how we make that money and our priorities in the way we spend money are also part of living into our baptism. The way we live each minute of the day is our best and most important offering, even more important that anything that has to do with money. Too often the offering seems to revolve around money, especially when we process plates of money down the aisle singing a doxology. What are ways we can expand our offering to include living the baptismal life?</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span face="Times New Roman"><br /></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span face="Times New Roman"><strong>Sending</strong> people into the world is another place where the image of water can remind us that we leave this place to live into our baptism. Perhaps you could use such words as this while pouring or splashing water:</span></p>

<blockquote><p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><em><span face="Times New Roman">We are the people of God, members of the household of faith, a royal priesthood. Let us proclaim with our lives the good news of Christ for all the world!</span></em></p></blockquote>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span face="Times New Roman">These images are just scratching the surface of the mystery of baptism. There are many more aspect of this life we live in faith and many more ways to express it. The Presbyterian Church USA is inviting all its member churches into five practices each Sunday:</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span face="Times New Roman"><br /></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><strong></strong></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><strong></strong></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><strong><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial;">1. Set the font in full view of the congregation.<br />2. Open the font and fill it with water on every Lord’s Day.</span></strong></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><strong><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial;">3. Set cup and plate on the Lord’s Table on every Lord’s Day.</span></strong></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><strong><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial;">4. Lead appropriate parts of weekly worship from the font and from the table.<br />5. Increase the number of Sundays on which the Lord’s Supper is celebrated.</span></strong></p>

<br /><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span face="Times New Roman">You can read the whole report, including supporting material that is helpful for studying and reflecting on baptismal life at </span><a href="http://pcusa.org/theologyandworship/worship/sacramentworkgroup.htm"><span style="color: #800080;">http://pcusa.org/theologyandworship/worship/sacramentworkgroup.htm</span></a><span face="Times New Roman"> <br /></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span face="Times New Roman"><br /></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span face="Times New Roman">By engaging in these practices each Sunday we can begin to explore how baptism is a part of every aspect of Christian living. Just a few examples would be forgiving others, caring for creation, what we do at our jobs (or our vocation), the way we spend money, we interact with others, all this is grounded in the life of faith which is the baptismal life. The mysteries of the faith are never fully exhausted. These practices can be explored each and every time the community of faith gathers and even in our daily prayer. </span></p>

<p>His parents were eager to do this because their families -- on both sides -- have deep connections to the &quot;Big Lake&quot; as home. In the service, I pointed to the appropriateness of the link the water made between family initiation and initiation into the larger family of God.&nbsp; </p>

<p>But more than that, I suggested that using water from this natural resource -- so dominant and precious to us in the midwest -- highlights the deep connection between the grace of God offered in baptism and the responsibility we gratefully take on as Christ's disciples to care for the world in which that grace is manifest.&nbsp; It says something damning to us if the water in our backyard streams, or rivers, or lakes is so polluted that we cannot in good common sense bathe in it, or in good conscience call it &quot;living&quot; water.&nbsp; Perhaps my nephew Samuel will grow up, in service to Jesus, to be a biologist who concerns himself with the health of Lakes Michigan, Superior, Huron, Ontario, and Erie.&nbsp; </p>

I splashed my head with the cool, clear water (it was a hot day), I
thought to myself: &quot;What a great place to have a
baptism service!&quot;&nbsp; There is easily room around the perimeter of the
scultpure for an average-sized
congregation&nbsp; -- maybe 100 people.&nbsp; (In the real world we call this the
&quot;fourth coast,&quot; and it is home to about 30 million, or 1/10 the US
population).&nbsp; </p>

<p>A pastor could dunk the one to be baptized down in that corner by
Lake Erie, where there are three bubbling fountains.&nbsp; Then invite each
member of the congregation to put his or her hand in the water, get
wet, and remember, in a genuinely aquatic, tactile way, the promises
God makes to us, and the responsibilities of our promises in response.

<p>We have written before (<a href="http://worshiphelps.blogs.com/worship_helps/2006/04/recovering_test.html">here</a>, <a href="http://worshiphelps.blogs.com/worship_helps/2006/02/further_thought.html">here</a>, and <a href="http://worshiphelps.blogs.com/worship_helps/2006/02/where_to_put_th.html">here</a>) about incorporating lament into worship.&nbsp; Most often such prayers are corporate rather than individual.&nbsp; The harsh language of the Psalmic lament is difficult for most individuals to appropriate in their own devotional lives.&nbsp; We have somehow learned that asking questions of God is irreverent, especially if those questions have a rebuking tone.&nbsp; But the Psalms teach us that such questions are a central part of a relationship with God, and Scripture as a whole teaches us that God can probably handle our mild rants once in a while.&nbsp; </p>

<p><a href="http://worshiphelps.blogs.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/lament.jpg" onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=350,height=413,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false"><img width="160" height="188" border="0" alt="Lament" title="Lament" src="https://worshiphelps.blogs.com/worship_helps/images/lament.jpg" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;" /></a>
One interesting way to encourage folks to pray prayers of lament (whether publically or privately) is to prompt the prayers with an interrogative word, like &quot;why&quot; or &quot;where&quot; or &quot;when&quot; or &quot;how long.&quot;&nbsp; (The phrase &quot;how long&quot;, in fact, is used over 20 times in the Psalms alone.)&nbsp; This way, our prayers for peace in the Middle East, for example, are not merely petitions for wise leadership; they become&nbsp; expressions of our own helplessness: &quot;When, O Lord, will your children in the Middle East stop firing rockets at one another?&quot;&nbsp; </p>

<p>After the jump is a short devotional service based on this idea.&nbsp; It embeds the prayer of lament within both a sung Kyrie and a concluding Alleluia.&nbsp; It also contextualizes the prayer&nbsp; -- both the lament and the declaration of God's ultimate sovereignty -- as continuous with the &quot;words of the faithful in all times and places.&quot; </p>

<p>One of the neat features of the service was a skit composed and improvised by seminarians that illustrated the contrast between the flippant way we use the word &quot;blessing&quot; and the powerful way the word is understood in scripture.&nbsp; </p>

<p>They did this by juxtaposing funny 3-4 line sketches with longer scriptural or other readings.&nbsp; Examples of both after the jump.</p>

beautiful and it is appalling. It races through the barren hills to an

Hey Ron,

Thanks for reminding me of this song. I think it's one of the better examples of the its genre. I have mixed feelings about the movement of updating classic hymn texts with new music, even though I've done it myself on occasion (http://gregscheer.com/praise/may_the_mind.html). I'm all for it in principle, but in practice the modernized hymns are often less singable and less memorable than the ones they replace. Also, the texts are often kept intact with all the "thees" and "thous" which creates a strange tension between old text and new music. Sometimes this anachronistic approach works, sometimes it's awkward, but it always leaves me wondering whether these songwriters' talents would be better utilized by simply composing a completely new song.

Speaking of completely new songs, here's one of mine that's based on Psalm 103: http://gregscheer.com/praise/my_soul_will_glorify.html

</p>






<p>In some worshipping traditions, the &quot;prayers of the people&quot; are
anything but.&nbsp; The people don't do much praying at all-- they mostly
endure the sincere but longish monologic ramblings of a pastor.&nbsp; Those
congregations who practice a bidding prayer fare a bit better, but
their responses (&quot;Hear our prayer, O Lord&quot;) can sometimes become dry
and rote rather than heartfelt affirmation.<br /><br />Here is one suggestion for addressing these deficiencies while accomplishing a number of ancillary purposes: </p>

<p>1) increasing congregational participation in the prayers of the people; <br />2) letting the prayer's shape be suggested by the prayerbook of God's people -- the Psalms;<br />3) making room within the prayer not only for speaking, but for listening to God's voice.</p>

<div class="entry-more">
				<p class="MsoNormal">At the appropriate point in the service, a leader/liturgist introduces the prayers of the people
with words that connect with the theme of the sermon and perhaps the service itself.&nbsp; </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">For example, if the service was based on the
readings for Proper 7, year B of the Revised Common Lectionary (Jesus
stilling the storm and associated texts), the leader might use words
like these: </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">“The scriptures tell us that Christ has the power to calm the storms of our
lives, and rescue us in trouble.&nbsp; In that confidence and hope, let us pray
together…”</p>

<ul><li>Then the congregation, led by musicians and pehaps a cantor,
sings through a short and appropriate ostinato refrain.&nbsp; For this
subject, I might choose <em>Calm to the Waves </em>(Text by Mary Louise Bringle, Tune by Thomas Pavlechko; found in the ELCA's <em>Renewing Worship </em>#263).&nbsp; </li>

<li>The congregation sings the refrain twice.&nbsp; </li>

<li>Then, while the music continues underneath, a second leader/liturgist reads
the first three verses of Psalm 107:&nbsp; “O give thanks to the Lord for he is good;
for his steadfast love endures forever.&nbsp; Let the redeemed of the Lord say
so, those he redeemed from trouble and gathered in from the lands, from the
east and from the west, from the north and from the south” (NRSV).<br /> </li>

<li>The first liturgist (or pastor) follows this with extemporaneous prayers of thanksgiving
for God’s goodness – especially occasions where God’s power was exercised in
love on behalf of those in the congregation, to rescue them from trouble. 
 </li>

<li>The congregation sings the refrain again.&nbsp; &nbsp;</li>

<li>A liturgist (perhaps a different one) speaks verses 23-30 of Ps.
107.&nbsp; These verses should be read very slowly, letting the congregation
feel the weight of their lament.</li>

<li>The praying liturgist/pastor offers prayers identifying the storms and troubles, and prays
specifically for rescue. </li>

<li>The congregation sings the refrain again. </li>

<li>A third liturgist reads vv. 31-32 of Ps. 107</li>

<li>The pastor/liturgist concludes the prayers of the people with thanksgiving – in
advance – for God’s healing, love, and compassion. </li>

<li>The congregation sings the refrain twice to conclude.</li></ul>

<p>Here is an idea to strengthen you experience of baptismal renewal. Take a walk! <a href="http://worshiphelps.blogs.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/river_2.jpg" onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=103,height=345,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false"><img width="159" height="535" border="0" alt="River_2" title="River_2" src="https://worshiphelps.blogs.com/worship_helps/images/river_2.jpg" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;" /></a>
</p>

<p>This may not sound very revolutionary, but any movement at all in my congregation carries the threat of something going awry. Our large mainline congregation typically restricts its movement to arriving, standing, sitting, and departing. Now we are about to take a walk together past the baptismal waters as a sign of remembrance and renewal.</p>

<p>We are about to reflect together upon the story of Peter walking on water. His first steps brought the threat of sinking. Our steps bring the threat of tripping over someone’s walker or stepping on a neighbor’s foot. – As the pastor receiving Monday morning quarterbacking, I’m not sure which is scarier!</p>

<p>Placed in the context of Peter’s walk, our congregational journey will be just a token of the faithful risk we are called to share. Members will bring their offerings forward as they physically move toward the front of the sanctuary. (I’m told there are some African communities where this act of offering is the most joyful and powerful part of the service!) Upon placing their offering (and their heart!) before the Lord, they will pass the baptismal waters and be given opportunity to touch the water and remember God’s claim on their lives.</p>

<p>Children will be baptized at the start of our worship service. This exercise will be placed after the proclamation of the Word. It will be a remembrance of the baptismal act that further invites the congregation into the sacrament that was shared.</p>

<p>Peter’s success came when his eyes were fixed on Christ. The challenge for us will be to lead with words of comfort and assurance that empower the congregation to take this minor risk of ardor. When we structure the event with order, it will become a moment of welcome and hospitality for the congregation to renew their spiritual life together.</p>

<p>Our congregation may not be filled with folks courageous enough to wade “in” the water. However, this wading “by” the water should be invitation enough to remember <em>who</em> they are.</p>

<p>It often seems that tradition is in the eyes of the beholder. </p>

<p>A friend visited for a while with our large suburban congregation and suggested that what she discovered was a heritage of worship that was part town hall meeting, part local talent show, and part lecture series. Perhaps there are other congregations whose Ordo follows in a similar path. </p>

<p>As pastor of the congregation for a little over two years, I have been faced with a number of questions related to local tradition. Making appeals to the great traditions of the church and faith don’t carry much freight for people who mark tradition according to what their parents taught them or what the last great preacher suggested. </p>

<p>For large churches, change often comes slowly with much conversation – especially if change is rare and sometimes has been disastrous. </p>

<p>Bearing this in mind, we have created safe spaces for conversations about worship. The conversation was structured by a graduate student we engaged for the purpose of exploration in small group and one-on-one interviews. As you might imagine, our conversations about worship were all over the map. We discovered yearnings amongst some for dimensions of worship that we did not offer at the time our questions were asked. </p>

<p><a href="http://worshiphelps.blogs.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/openhand_2.jpg" onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=125,height=125,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false"><img width="160" height="160" border="0" src="https://worshiphelps.blogs.com/worship_helps/images/openhand_2.jpg" alt="Openhand_2" title="Openhand_2" style="margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px; float: left;" /></a> In large measure, those expressed yearnings related to a sense of emotion and involvement that some felt was lacking in our more traditional church setting. So we decided to create some space for innovation. We are currently in the process of adding a new service of worship. The idea of adding an alternate worship service is nothing new.&nbsp; What is new (thus far) is the cooperative spirit being shared as we progress.&nbsp; This spirit is the outcome of much communication in many different forms.&nbsp; Since we began the process with an open conversation, the continuing development of new worship has become a shared conversation in meaning and problem-solving for the congregation. </p>

<p>A friend is joining us in a few weeks to offer a worship service that demonstrates for the congregation the way that we can add a “contemporary” feel while also rediscovering the riches of sacramental practice. I suppose this is a small move toward &quot;emerging worship.&quot; Learning to dance in large churches is, as some have coined the phrase, like waltzing a gorilla – so small steps are alright. </p>

<p>One purpose of our “trial” worship service is to expand a conversation about experience, meaning, and tradition. One small thing we will do on that day is outlined in an idea you might try (listed in the ritual section - “Wade by the Water”). This is an example of the “small steps” I named above. </p>

<p>Ultimately, exploration of tradition in local context relates to the relational character of ministry. It’s been my experience that time and trust open pathways for conversation and innovation. It also has been my experience that larger numbers of people require larger amounts of time for conversation about any change. </p>

<p>When we create avenues for trust and conversation in congregations, then our boundaries for tradition and imagination begin to expand. As leaders, we create room for congregants to see their relationship to other believers in every time and place. If tradition is ultimately a kind of “handing down,” then one task of leadership is to join hand to hand through the gentle art of friendly conversation.</p>

<p>Everyone wants heightened spirituality, but don’t know what it takes to get there. Most pastors and worship leaders have such a hectic schedule that it is impossible to slowdown enough for quiet time or solitude. Yet the Apostolic Fathers of faith placed a high value on it. </p>

<p>If leaders have a problem with carving out quiet moments can you imagine what the congregation is feeling? Jonny Baker and Doug Gay’s <em>Alternative Worship: Resources from and for the Emerging Church</em>, provides a “ritual” that contextualizes the spiritual practice of being in the desert that can be used as part of a worship service, small group gathering, or as teaching illustration.</p>

<p> Items needed: Removed Van seat, a boom box, selection of CD’s (ideally instrumental), a video projector and VCR. Video tape a drive down the highway, even being stuck in traffic, or driving through the city.</p>

<p>Description: Traveling in a car is the closest thing for most people get to solitude. “Setting up this ritual will hopefully help people to reflect positively on the space they have next time they are driving alone in the car” (Baker and Gay, Alternative Worship, Baker Books, Grand Rapids, 2004, 86)</p>

<p><a onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=120,height=80,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false" href="http://worshiphelps.blogs.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/123037.jpg"><img width="160" height="106" border="0" src="https://worshiphelps.blogs.com/worship_helps/images/123037.jpg" title="123037" alt="123037" style="margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px; float: left;" /></a>Baker and Gay suggest setting up a station that simulates driving in a car. The guests will receive an instruction sheet encouraging them to use this time to listen to music, reflect and pray. You would set up the van/car seats facing a screen. Place the boom box or a Discman personal CD play with headsets on the seat. The listener can select the music that they would like to listen to. Project the driving video onto the screen from behind the seats, which will simulate a car ride. The goal is that every time they take a drive, they can positively connect this space with an opportunity to connect with God and creating a contemporary desert experience. </p>

<p>I love singing with children - (well, most of the time, but that part doesn't come into this story). They soak up words and melodies like sponges, storing them away and pouring them out at every opportunity, “in season and out of season” - as the parents in our church ruefully attest. </p>

<p>What makes a good children's hymn? Or a good song for young people? Nobody I know, and no-one I've ever read, has ever come up with the formula. </p>

<p>The problem is compounded by the fact that children will gleefully and confidently sing a song that is not at all what we think of as a “children's” hymn. Three-and-a-half year-old Joseph in our church can sing “Kwase, Kwase/Be Like Him” by Kirk Franklin, or join his (younger) brother Benjamin in a duet of “U ya-i mose” from Zimbabwe. (Two-year old Benjamin sings the bass part.) And, while I'm thinking of it, I remember 11- and 12-year-olds singing - lustily and with good courage - Charles Wesley's “And can it be that I should gain” at every opportunity at summer camp.</p>

<p>Then there's the practical challenge. In the classic worship situation, children troop up to the front for the Children's Sermon while we adults sing verse 1 and 2 of a hymn that mentions children. Then, as they head off to Sunday School, we sing the 3rd and final verse. We might be singing a worthy hymn, but we are really using it as walking music, a sung processional and recessional to frame the children's time up at the front. </p>

<p>Making a place for children's song in worship brings with it some practical problems - not the least of which is that many of the kids don't read yet. Even if they do, they don't carry hymnbooks up to the front. I'm also not convinced that (even for readers) projected words on the screen are the answer. Give me a human face any time - but that is also another story.</p>

<p>Of course, the content is important, but I look first at the form. I look for how its repetitions (rhythmic, melodic and lyrical) lead the singer into the heart of the song.&nbsp; Then I look at how the repetitive elements can be used in teaching.</p>

<p> I love African American spirituals and gospel songs for that reason. In my church, Trafalgar Presbyterian in Oakville, Ontario, we use one song for a month, linking it with the church school lesson. I think of it as repetition on a large scale, with the whole of worship for that month being the stanzas, and the children's hymn being the refrain.</p>

<p>We used “I'm Gonna Sit at the Welcome Table” while they were studying communion. We used “Joshua Fit de Battle of Jericho” while they were studying the Joshua story, and (since it was Black History month) linked it with stories of African Canadians and African Americans making other kinds of walls fall down.</p>

<p>
Our choir sang “Guide My Feet” (thanks to the new “African American Heritage Hymnal” from GIA) as an anthem, and I am looking forward for just the right time to use it with the children.</p>

<p>We use other kinds of repetition. Two weeks ago, we used the opening lines of Handel's “Hallelujah” from “Messiah” as a response to the call to worship.</p>

<p>John Bell's “Jesus is risen from the grave” and “When Jesus the healer” both use repetition as a way into the story and we have used the repetition in various ways. Sometimes I have the adults begin each new verse, and then gesture for the children to continue. I take time at the beginning of worship, when necessary, to teach how we will do the children's song later in worship.</p>

<p>I often have them sing by themselves and unaccompanied, either for a whole verse or chorus, or singing the repeating line. When the song depends on their voices - and they can hear the difference - they gladly fill the acoustic space created for them. It lets us all know that there are times when “a child shall lead them.”</p>

<p>To Be Continued.<br />

Then I happened upon Don Saliers’ book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0687014581/ref=pd_bxgy_img_a/103-5407787-3041462?%5Fencoding=UTF8"><em>Worship Comes to Its Senses</em></a> (Abingdon Press, Nashville, 1996), which makes me come to my senses, changing my vantage point, to God’s perspective. I realized that my problems were larger than life because I did not think &quot;highly&quot; of God, I had lost my sense of awe. In Matthew 9, some friends bring their paralyzed friend to see Jesus. Jesus said to the man, “Get up, take your mat and go home” (Matt. 9:6). Then in verse 7, the crowd was “filled with awe, and they praised God”. The crowd's view of God was enlarged! They praise God with awe.</p>

<p>Saliers encourages us to reconnect real life to the worship of the God of the Universe! </p>

<p>He accents Jaroslav Vajda’s new hymn “God of the Sparrow God of the Whale” which crosses generational lines and is a contemporary way to express to our awe in biblical tradition.&nbsp; Lyrics after the jump...</p>

United Methodist Hymnal, United Methodist Publishing House, Nashville,
1989, no. 122.</span></p>


<p>This hymn provides with us new images of God and yet stirs questions
that we must ask. I may have questions that I have no answers for;
still I cannot loose my sense of wonder and awe of God. <a href="http://www.mattredman.com/">Matt Redman</a>
said, “I love the cathedrals in England, because they make me look up
and make me feel small.” I needed to reignite my sense of awe with
Salier's book and this hymn. Vajdav helped me look up,feel small, with
awe.</p>

BODY:
<p>Paul’s sermon in Athens (Acts 17:22-31) is substantially different from any of his other sermons. While his other sermons are identifiably Pharisaical and present the gospel in a way that would be accessible to a predominantly Jewish audience, the Athenian sermon employs patterns and concepts which were common to first century Athens. It is a significant and noteworthy accomplishment on Paul’s part and it may be taken as a mandate to subsequent Christians always to be prepared to articulate the gospel message using new and distinct cultural patterns. While the content of the Gospel is always consistent, the form in which the good news of Jesus Christ is presented should always be flexible. What follows are excerpts from a somewhat playful worship service that was designed to illustrate to a worshiping community the issues and possibilities involved in attempting to articulate a Christian worship service in a particular context.&nbsp; &nbsp;College students, youth, and children are often engaged by this way of distinguishing between what is essential and what is negotiable in worship.&nbsp; &nbsp;Read the liturgy after the jump.</p>

BODY:
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">While planning a worship service at Austin College in Sherman, Texas, one student said, “If we’re going to do the Kiss of Peace, can we play Spin the Bottle?” Although her comment was intended as a joke, she and the other students—with the encouragement of the college chaplain—developed a version of “Spin the Bottle” as an appropriate and authentic part of our Christian communion service.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><br /></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">After the Invitation to the Lord’s Table, Eucharistic Prayer, and Words of Institution, a worshiper who was chosen before the service began, took an empty water bottle and spun it on the floor of the Chapel. When it came to a stop, the first worshiper and the worshiper toward whom the bottle was pointing met in the middle of the Chapel, exchanged the Mar Thoma Kiss of Peace, and then went to the communion table and served the Eucharist to each other.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Arial;">Then the next worshiper spun the bottle and met the person toward whom it pointed in the middle of the Chapel. They exchanged the Mar Thoma Kiss of Peace and went to the Table and served the Sacrament to each other.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><br /></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"></p>







<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">We learned about the “Mar Thoma” Kiss of Peace from an Austin College student who was part of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mar_Thoma_Syrian_Church_of_India">Mar Thoma Church of India</a>. We have begun to use it often in our worship because it is an appropriate and non-threatening way for worshipers to touch each other.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><br /> </span></p>





<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;"></span><span style="font-family: Arial;">
To exchange the Mar Thoma Kiss of Peace, two worshipers face each other, extend their hands forward, and then touch hands so that the right hand of each worshiper is between the palms of the two hands of the other. One worshiper then says, “The peace of Christ be with you,” and the other responds, “And also with you.”</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><br /></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Students find this to be an enriching part of worship because—with a little assisted reflection—they realize that they might be paired with a close friend or they might be paired with a fellow worshiper whom they had not even known before the service began. In either case, worshipers are reminded that our lives as Christians—as the Body of Christ in the world—might involve both those to whom we are closest and others who we may not know at all. </span></p>

<p>
Take Pentecost for example. The story in Acts 2 is rich with allusion,
imagery, history, narrative - all of which have filled many books and
many sermons. If we frame the reading of the story with a musical
response sung by the congregation, we encourage the worshipping
community to glimpse more of those layers. More than glimpse:
experience.</p>

<p>
It is the prophet Joel's story: though he'd lived long before New
Testament times, his presence continued to be felt. Repeating the
refrain reminds us of the prophetic witness that informs this account
of the event.</p>

<p>
It is a Jewish story: there were many Jewish renewal movements before,
during and after Jesus' time. The events described by Luke took place
during Shavu'oth, the harvest festival, with Jewish pilgrims gathered
in Jerusalem from all over the known world. The music below is in the
form of a hora, a Jewish dance of celebration. Even though the
composition is modern - and we of course do not know how the music of
the time of Jesus sounded - the music itself can give us a flavour of
the times.</p>

<p>
This is our story: singing a response allows us to both listen and participate in it.<br />
The music lives in our soul long after we've left the worship space, drawing us back into the story to experience new insight. </p>

<p>
Singing also gives children an access into the scripture reading: they
can remember short texts and repeated melodies and rhythms. Parents in
my church community often ask me how to get their children to stop
singing - over and over and over - music they learned in church.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt; text-indent: 0.5in;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Tahoma;">Lord, on this day set aside to honor and remember mothers, we give you thanks for our mothers. We are grateful that you chose to give us life through them, and that they received the gift of life from your hands, and gave it to us. Thank you for the sacrifices they made in carrying us and giving us birth.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt; text-indent: 0.5in;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Tahoma;">We thank you for the women who raised us, who were our mothers in childhood. Whether birth mom, adopted mom, older sister, aunt, grandmother, stepmother or someone else, we thank you for those women who held us and fed us, who cared for us and kissed away our pain. We pray that our lives may reflect the love they showed us, and that they would be pleased to be called our moms.</span></p>

Hear now the first names of other women who have inspired us by their motherly examples . . . We are mindful this day of all these women, and especially Mary the mother of our Lord Jesus Christ, who had the courage in faith to say “yes” to your calling. May these women gathered here today emulate these examples of faith. And may they model for all the rest of us what it means to be your disciple. Bless them on this special day; in the name of Jesus Christ. <strong>Amen</strong>.</span></p>

BODY:
<p>In addition to our recent post on Mother’s Day I would add a few more seeds for thought.&nbsp; During the season of Easter it is appropriate to remember our baptism each Sunday service.&nbsp; In re-membering our baptism we are re-minded that God has claimed us as children and we have made promises to God to live into the life of Christ.&nbsp; This means promises to serve others (especially the “least of these”), to be faithful to prayer, breaking bread and taking care of the community of faith as any has need (yes, I’m evoking the last part of Acts chapter 2).&nbsp; During the rite of baptism the community also makes vows to love, care and nurture those God is claiming through water and the Spirit. We are also called to nurture each other in the faith.<a onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=800,height=1066,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false" href="http://worshiphelps.blogs.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/imr00035.jpg"><img width="160" height="213" border="0" src="https://worshiphelps.blogs.com/worship_helps/images/imr00035.jpg" title="Imr00035" alt="Imr00035" style="margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px; float: left;" /></a>
</p>

<br /><p>Remembering our baptism this Mother’s Day may be a way to honor both the season of Easter and mothers.&nbsp; You may begin the service standing by the font, giving thanks for water, God’s promises to us and reminding the community of the promises we make to each other during the time of baptism.&nbsp; One resource for remembering baptism can be found from the ELCA’s <a href="https://download.elca.org/ELCA%20Resource%20Repository/What_are_the_practices_for_remembering_and_affirming_baptism.pdf">Holy Baptism and Related Rites</a>.&nbsp; Perhaps on this day we can accentuate the vows to love and care for one another.&nbsp; This is a way you can talk about how mothers, at their best, who live into these promises of baptism through their care and nurture of children (not just their own but all children of the community).&nbsp; In this way mothers, and Mother’s Day points back to baptism and a life in Christ as opposed to the worship pointing to a cultural holiday.&nbsp; </p>

<p><a href="http://worshiphelps.blogs.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/mothersday2.png" onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=270,height=270,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false"><img width="120" height="120" border="0" alt="Mothersday2" title="Mothersday2" src="https://worshiphelps.blogs.com/worship_helps/images/mothersday2.png" style="margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px; float: right;" /></a><a href="http://rienstra.blogspot.com/2006/05/consumer-culture-catechumenate.html">

I’ve
been reading</a> lately about how our consumer culture tempts the Christian
with a competing and compelling way of being in the world.&nbsp; It even has
its own calendar, featuring economic “holy days” in which we are encouraged to
engage in ritualized pagan practices.&nbsp; This upcoming Sunday, Mother’s Day,
notwithstanding its <a href="http://mothers-day.123holiday.net/">ostensibly
Christian origins</a>, is one such day. </p>

<p>Not surprisingly, many churches participate in the cultural holiday by
having special “Mother’s Day” worship services.&nbsp; This is not in itself a
necessarily bad thing.&nbsp; The church excels at baptizing culturally suspect
practices and turning them to God’s good ends.&nbsp; And I love my mother, I
love my wife, and I happen to be a huge fan of motherhood and know well the <a href="https://debrarienstra.com/great-with-child/">spiritual value</a> that being a parent
can bring. </p>

<p>But we’re on dangerous ground when the Church’s worship on this day turns
away from new life in Jesus Christ, and turns rather into a slightly veiled
civic celebration of the “traditional” family and the woman’s often subservient
role within it.&nbsp; We are on slick footing when we plan services that have
less to do with engaging a triune God and more to do with handing out a
bit of instruction regarding our own preferred parenting methods.&nbsp; We
risk pastoral malpractice when we put a certain type of woman on a pedestal,
take a soft-focus picture, and offer bland, if well-meant praise, all the while
ignoring the pain and the gifts of other types of women in our congregations:
unwed mothers, women who have had abortions, women who have suffered from
undesired childlessness, and women, both single and wed, for whom God’s call
does not include children at all.&nbsp; </p>

<p>So this Mother’s Day, make use of the counter-cultural liturgical calendar,
and follow the <a href="http://www.textweek.com/yearb/easterb5.htm">lectionary
readings</a> for your service planning. And then let the struggles of family life and motherhood inform a rich
pastoral prayer, like one of these from the <a href="http://www.lca.org.au/">Lutheran
Church in Australia</a>:</p>

<p>God of all life,<br />
We thank you for adopting us into your family through the miracle of baptism, <br />
and for calling us to be brothers and sisters to each other <br />
through Jesus, the only Son of God. <br />
Today, loving Father, we pray for our mothers: <br />
who cared for us when we were helpless, <br />
who comforted us when we were hurt, <br />
whose love and care we usually took for granted, <br />
 as we often take your love for
granted. <br />
Today we pray for: <br />
those who are grieving the loss of their mother, <br />
 maybe even years after they were
separated;<br />
those who never knew their biological mother, <br />
 and now yearn for her;<br />
those who have experienced the wonder of an adopted mother’s love;<br />
the families separated in the wars in ___. <br />
Lord, give them special blessings.&nbsp; <br />
Keep us united with Christ, so that we can love in the way he loves us and all
people.&nbsp; <br />
We ask this for Jesus’ sake. Amen.</p>

<p>Gracious God, we pray: <br />for new mothers, coming to terms with both the joys and demands of motherhood; <br />for pregnant mothers,
expectant and wondering, or fearful; <br />for those mothers who are tired, stressed, ill or depressed; <br />for those who struggle to balance the demands of work and children; <br />for those who have to struggle with difficult decisions about whether or not to become a mother or to have another child; <br />for those who are unable to feed their children due to poverty; <br />for those whose children have physical, mental or emotional disabilities; <br />for those who have children they do not want; <br />for those who raise children on their own; <br />for those who have lost a child through death or abortion; <br />for those who care for the children of others; <br />for those whose children have left home; <br />for those whose children have rejected their love; <br />and for those whose desire to be a mother has not been fulfilled. <br />Bless all mothers, that their love may be deep and tender, and that they may lead their children to know and do what is good, living not for themselves, but for God and for others.&nbsp; We pray by the power of the Holy Spirit, and the name of Jesus Christ.&nbsp; Amen.</p>

In a class I'm teaching on Crafting Language for Worship, we recently had a discussion about the value of significant words and repeated phrases in worship.&nbsp; Some of my students from evangelical and free-church traditions reported with delight the value they have discovered in the the persistent Easter season call-and-response &quot;Christ is risen!&nbsp; Alleluia!/<em>He is risen indeed, Alleluia!&quot;&nbsp; &nbsp;</em>They report that using this refrain now is profoundly formative, reminding them of the catholicity of the church, and connecting them with the faithful of so many times and places. </p>

<p>All of this reminded me of a time when my congregation practiced a fast from the use of the word &quot;Alleluia&quot; throughout the season of Lent in anticipation of its exuberant reintroduction to worship on Easter Sunday.&nbsp; Throughout the forty days, we still sang songs with &quot;alleluia&quot; in the lyrics, but self-consciously hummed &quot;mm-mm-MM-mm&quot; instead.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Meanwhile, the young children of the church spent one of their education hours creating colorful construction paper butterflies, decorated abundantly with the word &quot;Alleluia.&quot;&nbsp; &nbsp;These were then crafted into a beautiful mobile, which debuted on Easter morning hanging high over the communion table, pointing to new life in Christ.&nbsp; Alleluia!&nbsp; He is risen!</p>

<p>I've been using a tool for small group worship that has helped bring a fresh twist to 'plain ol' strumming and singing.</p>

<p>I print out twently-four, 8.5 x 11 sheets that each have an artfully fonted, black and white excerpt from the Psalms or some other praise text.&nbsp; If the room is large, I print out double-copies.&nbsp; Before leading, I hang these sheets on the walls of the worship space using scotch tape.&nbsp; Some I hang low on the wall, some eye-level, and some higher.&nbsp; Some sheets, I scatter on the floor.&nbsp; It is best to have the sheets three to five feet apart from each other.</p>

<p><a href="http://worshiphelps.blogs.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/sp_eg.jpg" onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=394,height=305,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false"></a><a onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=394,height=305,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false" href="http://worshiphelps.blogs.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/sp_eg_1.jpg"><img width="250" height="193" border="0" src="https://worshiphelps.blogs.com/worship_helps/images/sp_eg_1.jpg" title="Sp_eg_1" alt="Sp_eg_1" style="margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px; float: left;" /></a>
<br />
</p>

<p>Typically, as I did early this morning for a Fuller D.Min. class, I begin with one song of declaratory praise, sung together.&nbsp; After that song is finished, I play quietly as I explain the worship excercise, saying:<br /> </p>

<p>1. Notice the words of praise from the scriptures scattered throughout the room.<br />2. As the music continues quietly, feel free to wander about, reading these verses.<br />3. You may read in silence.&nbsp; However, as a particular verse, phrase, or word impacts your soul, you are invited to read it aloud, spontaneously.<br />4. There is no hurry.&nbsp; We will allow several minutes to praise God through his Word in this way.</p>

<p>After the groups seems to have made it through most of the scriptures, I seemlessly lead into a final few songs.&nbsp; When this ritual is unfamiliar to the group at hand, it never fails to prompt a sincere and engaging worship response.</p>

<p>Free &quot;Scripture Posts&quot; can be downloaded <a href="http://www.unkeptrecords.com/downloads/resources/Scripture posts.pdf">&nbsp; here&nbsp; </a> (these were created by <a href="http://www.kline.blogspot.com">Aaron Klinefelter</a>)</p>

Very Cool!  I'm so glad these simple pages continue to help folks worship.  I remember the first time we did that in house church - I had no idea how or if it would work, but it did - very well.  It turned out to be a good way to engage folks in movement and participation that was open and non-threatening.

BODY:
<p>Just for fun I thought I'd post a list of music we're using this Sunday with some notes about the choices:</p>

<p>4/30/06 3rd Sunday of Easter<br />Scripture readings: Psalm 116 and Colossians 1:15-23 (sermon text)</p>

<p>OPENING HYMN:<br />Bb – A Shout Rings Out/Daar juicht een toon (PsH 392)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; “prelude” choir sings verse 1 in Dutch<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; then with cong 4 verses</p>

<p>OT SCRIPTURE:<br />Psalm 116 with “I Love the Lord” (SNC 227)<br />(We'll volley back and forth between the reader and the people singing the song.)</p>

<p>PRE-SERMON HYMN:<br />The First Place<br />(A great song by Matthew Westerholm which fits the sermon scripture like a glove. I created backing vocals for the choir to fill out the refrain a bit.)</p>

<p>COMMUNION:<br />D - God So Loved the World (choir only)<br />D – At the Name of Jesus/Walker (JN 32)<br />D/Eb – Oh Que Bueno (PsH 401)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; (using clave, maracas and bongos to bring the rhythm to life)<br />Eb - Beautiful Savior (JN 5)<br />Eb – O Christ, the Great Foundation (SNC 177)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; (May use the &quot;Let It Rip&quot; arrangement of the tune “Aurelia”)</p>

<p>By way of context, the congregation is Church of the Servant in Grand Rapids. It's a liturgical CRC church with strong ties to Calvin College, Calvin Seminary and the Calvin Institute of Christian Worship. Stylistically, we lean heavily on the Psalter Hymnal and Sing! a New Creation. We also use a good bit of global music, some home grown songs, and dip lightly into choral repertoire and praise and worship.</p>

<p>Peace,</p>

<p>Greg Scheer</p>

In order to illustrate and remember the difference between unity and uniformity, our worshiping community occasionally prays the Lord’s Prayer in the following way:


Persons who can recite the Lord’s Prayer in a language other than English are invited to do so.&nbsp; Others are invited to recite the Lord’s Prayer as they learned it.&nbsp; Participants unfamiliar with the Lord’s Prayer, or who desire to recite it in Spanish are invited to read one of the versions below:


</p>

<p>

Our Father&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; <strong>Padre nuestro</strong><br />Who art in heaven&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<strong> que estás en los cielos, </strong><br />Hallowed be Thy name&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>santificado sea tu nombre.</strong><br />Thy Kingdom come.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<strong> Venga tu reino. </strong><br />Thy will be done&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>Hágase tu voluntad,</strong><br />On Earth as it is in heaven.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; <strong> como en el cielo, así también en la tierra.</strong><br />Give us this day our daily bread&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>El pan nuestro de cada día, dánoslo hoy.</strong> <br />And forgive us our debts&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; <strong>Y perdónanos nuestras deudas,</strong><br />As we forgive our debtors&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>como también nosotros perdonamos <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; a nuestros deudores</strong>. <br />And lead us not into temptation&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>&nbsp; Y no metas en tentación, </strong><br />But deliver us from evil;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>mas líbranos del mal;</strong><br />For Thine is the kingdom,&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; <strong>porque tuyo es el reino, </strong><br />And the power,&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<strong> y el poder,</strong><br />And the glory&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; <strong>y la gloria,</strong><br />Forever.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; <strong>por todos los siglos.</strong> <br />Amen.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; <strong>Amén.</strong></p>

<p><em></em><span lang="ES-TRAD" style="font-family: Arial;">

When the Lord’s Prayer is recited in this way, worshipers are able to recognize a rhythm and commonality to this most universal of Christian prayers that transcends the boundaries of lanuage or particular translations of scripture.

BODY:
<p>Our worship space is used for many other activities throughout the week. Chairs are stacked around the edge of the room and brought out and used by various groups. I have come to think of this multiple use of our worship space as an advantage for our worshiping community. Before each service, the Communion Table is placed in the room—not necessarily in the same place from week to week—and bread, wine, and water are placed on the Table, but no other advanced preparations are made. As worshipers enter, they each take one chair, place in the worship space, and take their seat. Worshipers with physical limitations are given help, but their chairs are not brought into the circle until they are present. No chairs are set up in anticipation of the arrival of others. There are a few significant features of this arrangement:

</p>

<ul><li>the worshiping community creates it own space;
</li>

<li>the circle of chairs is always exactly the right size;
</li>

<li>the room never looks exactly the same for any two services; and
</li>

<li>worshipers never walk into a room that has been prepared and arranged by someone else who has preconceived notions about how the space is “supposed” to look.

</li></ul>

<p>This seemingly insignificant feature of weekly worship has helped a group of 30-40 college students from a variety of Christian traditions take ownership of the weekly worship life of the particular community of which they are currently a part. Along with shared leadership, shared meals after worship, and regular reflection, this feature has helped a particular community of college students develop a unique and authentic worship life. </p>

BODY:
<p>Worship at Austin College —a Presbyterian Church (USA)-related college in Sherman Texas—includes the explicit assumption that all who attend are capable of participating in the leadership of worship.&nbsp; For this reason, after particular students and the College Chaplain plan a given service, a program is prepared that contains every word that anyone will say during the service (with the exception of the Proclamation of the Word and the Words of Institution).&nbsp; Worshipers always sit in a circle around the Communion Table.&nbsp; The portions spoken or sung by the congregation as a whole are printed in bold type.&nbsp; The portions to be read by an individual voice are printed in standard type.&nbsp; &nbsp;The single-voice sections are printed with a line skipped between each sentence or section.&nbsp; Whenever a line is skipped, the next person around the circle reads the next line.&nbsp; In this way, the leadership of the service moves around the circle. </p>

<p>No participant is required to do this.&nbsp; At the beginning of each service, this “Shared Leadership” model is explained and students who do not wish to read are encouraged to inform the persons on either
side of them.&nbsp; Then they are simply skipped over as the leadership passes from participant. </p>

<p>This model has proven to be very engaging and liberating for 18-22 year olds who often have little or no experience participating in worship leadership.&nbsp; Over a span of weeks, these services develop a rhythm that is inclusive of all participants, regardless of their particular denominational backgrounds. </p>

<p>Although some students initially express impatience with what they perceive to be the lack of spontaneity in this model, most of them eventually come to appreciate the exposure to the language and rhythms of worship that such a model entails.&nbsp; The fact that the services are planned by students and the Chaplain together helps to ensure that the language employed is authentic and accessible for the whole worshiping community.</p>

Ron,

	My assumption that all who attend worship are capable of worship leadership is very much influenced by Leonardo Boff, and particularly his book, Ecclesiogenesis (Maryknoll. NY: Orbis Books, 1986).  That book is a theological reflection on the Brazilian “Basic Communities” that arose in the 1970s and 1980s. I believe Boff articulates some significant insights about the nature of the church that are relevant for a faith community that has arisen out of the life of a church-related college.

	Of particular interest in this context are two statements from the book.  On page 4, Boff asserts that “Christian life in the basic communities is characterized by the absence of alienating structures…”   In the context of the life of a faith community on a college campus, this statement suggests that “alienating structures” should be avoided if at all possible.  We should try not to create situations in which we tell any students that they are not qualified to participate in worship leadership.  One way to do that is to maintain a distinction between liturgists (those who plan worship) and worship leaders.  Care should be taken to ensure that worship services are carefully planned, authentic to the community, and self-consciously and appropriately reflective of the tradition of the Church.  And I argue that part of that care, authenticity, and responsibility to the tradition is the implicit assumption that all members of the community bring gifts to worship.    
 
	On page 27, Boff states that “Charism…may be understood as each person’s own function in the community as a form of manifestation of the Spirit within the community for the community.”  Although such spiritual gifts are by no means limited to worship leadership, the careful structuring of worship services so that all participants may play a role in leadership reinforces the notion that all members of the community have been given gifts by God to be used to “serve on another” (I Peter 4:10).

	Three more quotes from Boff that are interesting in this context:
	“A community in which the routes of participation are cut off…cannot pretend to the name of community” (36).

	“As the basic communities grow, they themselves provide more and more of the services that meet their needs” (62).

	“By baptism an entire people becomes priestly” (69).

	At Pentecost, it didn’t sound like one or a few people talking.  There were as many voices as there were people present.  Services in our communities should include a similar variety of voices.

John,

This is quite helpful. I completely affirm: 
a) that all members bring gifts to the community for the upbuilding of the body
b) that all members should participate fully (actively, consciously) in worship.
c) that worship services should be planned to remove "alienating structures" as much as possible.

What I'm puzzling over is the notion that people are not participating in worship unless they are leading.  Do you mean that part of your planning process is to be certain that the gifts of everyone present are tapped in one way or another in the worship service?  How do you parse that out as a congregation?

Let me pose a hypothetical to sharpen the point:  Suppose I am part of a congregation where in our worship services all the words articulated by both leaders and people are sung.  In such a service, even those few among the body of Christ who are legitimately tone-deaf can <i>participate </i> along with others.  But clearly such persons are not gifted to <i>lead </i> the congregation (at least, not in this sort of service).  There are other ways such people serve the church and the world through their gifts, and there may be other ways in which such people bring those gifts to the liturgy as well.  But to ask them to lead by singing would not empower them, but in fact, dishonor them.  

A further question: do all members of the congregation have a part in the leadership tasks of preaching or presiding?  If the position you've articulated commits you to this, how would a church share those tasks among all members?

Ron,
I don't mean that the planning process needs to be certain that the particular gifts of everyone present need to tapped in one way or another in every worship service.  I believe, rather, that the ongoing process of planning worship services for a particular congregation should include intentional effort to tap the particular gifts of as many members as possible in the worship life of the congregation.  Further, since the community with whom I regularly work is an academic community made up of students who are engaged in the process of learning how to participate responsibly in communities and traditions, I believe there is value in encouraging and enabling them to see themselves as leaders who bear some responsibility for the life of the worshiping community in which they participate.  Although I don't mean to suggest that all members of a congregation are equally qualified to lead any aspect of the congregation's worship, I do think it is important to communicate by our practices that the services belong to the whole community and not just to the individuals who design or lead them.  And I think multiple voices reading spoken parts of a service is a good way to enact that truth.

With regard to your example about a congregation where all words articulated both by the leaders and the congregation are sung, I agree that leadership in such a service requires a particular set of gifts and that it is appropriate for decisions made about leadership in such a service to take into account the particular gifts of leaders.  I would worry, however, that a congregation that worshipped in that entirely appropriate way might eventually communicate subtly to its members that gifts for worship leadership are somehow limited to gifts for music leadership.  It seems to me that it would be good stwardship for such a congregation to work hard to identify ways to evoke and celebrate other gifts of other members and to celebrate and incorporate them into worship.  I have a vague theological concern about the church member who prefers worship services that she or he would never be qualified or interested to help lead.

Your last question was "Do all members of the congregation have a part in the leadership tasks of preaching and presiding?
No.  While the "Shared Leadership" approach involves a commitment to invite the entire worshiping community to take part in the leadership of worship, that commitment must be balanced by a commitment faithfully to represent and uphold the tradition of the Church.  The "Shared Leadership" approach does suggest working to employ forms of proclamation that engage the entire community.  Similarly, the Eucharistic liturgy should be constructed and enacted in a way that invites active participation by the entire congregation.  But the Church's concern that the Sacraments be administered with utmost care (which is essentially the reason for the requirement that they be administered by ordained clergy) is to be respected.

The point of all this "Shared Leadership" stuff is not simply to blur the lines between leaders and participants in a given worship service.  It is rather to try to develop and maintain a culture in which all worship is something that WE (the whole community) do--not something that a couple gifted people do while the rest of us watch.

John and Ron,

I enjoyed the conversation and hope that Boff's book (perhaps with references to the most valuable chapters) might make it on our book list here.

The subject matter is something I've been working on in a very different context than base communities or college campuses.  I'm working to apply it in a large suburban mainline church.

In this context, shared leadership relies on a permission giving and mentoring stance by those of us in the role of trained leadership.  Specifically, this requires the development of welcoming and "easy entry" structures.

Much of what I mean is possible through the work that Ron has been doing in helping churches map out their worship planning process.  We are working our way toward establishing patterns of collaboration on a seasonal basis.  

At this point, we are in the baby-steps stage.  That means that I am having to train myself and my colleagues that are in the trained leadership role on staff.  As we develop a more genuine collaborative structure for creative development of worship, we are learning how we can invite others into such planning.

This process of discovery is not easy because we have inherited a the self-reliant confidence that comes from years of leadership and training - the "we are the professionals" model.  In this model, it feels easier just to do it ourselves and rely upon our existing structured patterns for leadership.  In addition, the pace of our lives does not easily afford adequate reflective time for group development.  Yet I think that churches are ultimately better off when they are filled with many confident "professor"s.

I'll keep you posted on our development!

BODY:
<p>I have no business doing what I'm doing.&nbsp; I'm a United Methodist pastor by training and spent 25 years in parish ministry.&nbsp; But God's calling is never predictable.&nbsp; Five years ago I took a leap of faith based on that new calling and founded a ministry called The Ministry of Congregational Singing.&nbsp; &nbsp;I try to help congregations sort out why their singing has gotten timid or conflicted.</p>

<p>Then a year and a half ago, a colleague who now serves as mission director for United Methodism's new work in Cameroon emailed and said, in effect, &quot;I need someone to come over here and encourage the young leaders of the church to create their first hymnal/worshipbook.&quot;&nbsp; Since the first leap had been really energizing, I decided to leap again.&nbsp; </p>

<p>At one level, I was a fool to say yes.&nbsp; I had no business thinking I could walk into a bi-lingual culture (French/English) with only a few years of high school French and act as an entrepreneur of hope for people who had more music in their index fingers than I had in my whole body.&nbsp; But sometimes the call to do something comes before you have all the actual equipment to live in that call. </p>

<p>What I'll be doing in this blog is to tell stories about the journey I've had as a baby ethnomusicologist.&nbsp; I'll report the stumblings and the victories.&nbsp; I hope what will be most transparent is the degree to which what is happening in Cameroonian Methodism is nothing more or less than the grace of God taking amazing forms.</p>

<p>Blessings on the journey.</p>

I have always disliked serving communion in those little “shot glasses.” I’m sure there is an official name for them, but I’ve never learned it. The symbolism of rejecting a common cup in favor of individual serving sizes bothers me intensely. I’m just as bothered by the individual wafers for communion. In ordinary Lord’s Day worship, my congregation uses a common cup and a single loaf of bread, and we commune by intinction.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"></p>





<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span face="Times New Roman">My problem, until now, has been that I could not figure out a good way to use a common cup with shut-ins. All of the little communion “travel kits” made for pastors – at least the ones I’ve seen – use the little cups. In the case of the homebound, the use of individual serving sizes is especially bothersome to me. After all, aren’t they already isolated enough?</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"></p>





<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span face="Times New Roman">So, I made my own communion kit for visiting shut-ins. If you can find a store that sells teapots and tea cups, look for the kind used in Japanese and Chinese restaurants – the small, handleless kind. There are many varieties, but I’ve chosen one that looks like handmade pottery. You can also use the small dishes made for dipping bread in olive oil as a cup. Next, I found a very small cruet for the wine (juice in this case), a linen napkin in which to wrap a hearty dinner roll that looks like a small loaf of bread, and a small, hard-sided container in which to hold everything.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"></p>





<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span face="Times New Roman">It’s not a solution that leads to world peace, but it does allow the homebound to worship using a common loaf and cup. </span></p>

Hi,
I happened upon your post which addressed your search for alternatives to the little cups for homebound and hospital visitation, and thought I would pass along the link to our newest communionware designs: http://communionware.com/tempcomm.htm .

We have two versions of a one-piece intinction server that you might find useful.  Or perhaps our regular travel size sets may be of interest.  See http://communionware.com/Communion.htm for the complete list.  We are makers of pottery communion ware, located in Akron, Ohio.  FYI, Debra Ocepek

BODY:
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span face="Times New Roman">During this past Lenten season my congregation made space in the liturgy, just after the call to worship and before the communal prayer of confession, for testimony from members of the congregation. The tradition of offering public testimony has faded from many mainline congregations, especially those committed to liturgical worship. The Presbyterian congregation (PCUSA) I am currently serving as a temporary supply pastor is very much committed to classical forms of worship, but wanted to find a way to recover the tradition of testimony in ways consonant with that form of worship.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"></p>

<p><span face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span face="Times New Roman">Here’s what we did: During Lent we focused on the ways in which Jesus violates our expectations. Each week someone from the congregation offered a reflection how God had worked unexpectedly in his or her life, on ways in which God had violated expectations about what a good life ought to be. Testimonies lasted no more than two minutes, each one beginning and ending with the phrase, “the light shined in the darkness, and the darkness did not overcome it.” We created a “Lenten Wreath” similar to an Advent Wreath, except that instead of lighting one candle each week, we extinguished one after each testimony. By Passion Sunday, the wreath was as dark as a sealed tomb.</span></p>

BODY:
<p>My community has experienced the benefits of expressing our anger and confusion with God in a time of Lament.&nbsp; One time of lament that we (the worship arts team) came up with was particularly meaningful.&nbsp; We married two songs together and used a Psalm of Lament to structure our time.&nbsp; The Psalm was 60, and the songs were &quot;O God, Where are You Now?&quot; W/M by Sufjan Stevens and &quot;O God, Our Help in Ages Past,&quot; W/M by Watts/Croft.&nbsp; The first song can be found on the album &quot;Michigan.&quot;&nbsp; It contains the following stanzas, rich with meaning and content:</p>

<p>&quot;Oh God, where are you now? Oh God, save somehow</p>

<p>There's no other man who could raise the dead</p>

<p>So do what you can to anoint my head&quot;</p>

<p>Stevens is a young artist (and Hope College Grad) who has gained notoriety for his plan to write an album about all 50 states.&nbsp; &quot;Michigan&quot; and &quot;Illinois&quot; have been released, &quot;Oregon&quot;<a onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=347,height=420,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false" href="http://worshiphelps.blogs.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/sufjan.jpg"><img width="160" height="193" border="0" title="Sufjan" alt="Sufjan" src="https://worshiphelps.blogs.com/worship_helps/images/sufjan.jpg" style="margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px; float: left;" /></a>&nbsp; is currently being researched.&nbsp; Being an Episcopal, he no doubt approves of this liturgical use of his music.</p>

<p>We interspersed the three verses with the reading of the Psalm and with times of instrumental music (comping).&nbsp; We closed the time of Lament with the promises of scripture found at the end of Psalm 60 (&quot;Give us aid against the enemy, for human help is worthless.&nbsp; With God we will gain the victory...) and an almost a capella version of &quot;O God, Our Help in Ages Past&quot; (verse one only).&nbsp; We led the entire section in the musical key of C major for ease of singability.</p>

<p>I hope that this has been helpful and inspirational as you seek to plan meaningful times of lament in your own context.</p>

<p>For

a disgraced Tamar puts ashes on her head. Instead of thumbing the
cross, try pinching some ash (that’s asH) and sifting it like rubbing

I was at a church the other day where they did the most extraordinary thing at the offering.&nbsp; Instead of passing the plates and then bringing them up front to the doxology (&quot;Thanks for all the stuff you give us, God!&quot;), they passed the plates while two families came forward to bring testimony.&nbsp; </p>

<p>But here's the thing--the testimony had to do with what they did with their share of an offering that had been taken some weeks before.&nbsp; Apparently as a response to a sermon on the parable of the talents, that week's offering was divided up and given _back_ to the various households of the church.&nbsp; They were then instructed to use their share to invest in the Kingdom.&nbsp; </p>

<p>One family testified of their confab at which they discussed what to do with their money.&nbsp; They decided to buy a sheep for someone through the <a href="http://www.heifer.org/">Heifer Project</a>.&nbsp; But they didn't have enough money to do it.&nbsp; So each of the family members did something to try to earn more.&nbsp; The things were pretty typical: the teenage son mowed lawns on a Saturday, the young girl did a lemonade stand.&nbsp; In the end, they augmented what they had been given and had enough for the Sheep and a few chickens, too.&nbsp; </p>

<p>File this one as a fabulous theological connection between life and liturgy.</p>

This is a truly fabulous connection between life and liturgy.  The time of offering can be a perfunctory part of the service, but it can also be a time of renewal of one's efforts to live out faith in the world.  Thank you!

A wonderful way to make explicit the sacramental connection
between our everyday life and its distillation in liturgy is to sing a
variation on the Great Prayer over our ordinary meals. Chip Andrus, a
pastor, teacher, and musician with the Office of Theology and Worship
for the PC(USA) has written a lively folk prayer that works well for
just this purpose. 
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p>Sing
upbeat, but not too fast—maybe 88 bpm. The song is syncopated
throughout, but is notated more simply <a href="http://worshiphelps.blogs.com/worship_helps/CometotheTable.pdf">here</a> for easier learning. Once
you’re familiar with it as written, attempt appropriate syncopation
where you feel it (the third “come” in the first measure should
slightly anticipate the third beat). If you have trouble, ask your kids
for help. The song repeats the chorus a few times, and then concludes
moving to the tonic and repeating “come.”</p>

<p>This
wonderfully percussive tune works best antiphonally. When the meal is
almost ready, begin to sing (“Come, come, come!”) as you bring the food
from the kitchen to the table. Or send out a family member to the
corners of the house, singing and summoning everyone together. When all
are assembled, conclude with a spoken prayer to God, since this song is
a call to pray and feast rather than a prayer itself. </p>

<p>It’s
especially fitting to pray following a classic prayer pattern, like a
collect. So, for instance, begin by (1) addressing God and naming one
of God’s attributes (“God, you are . . .”); then (2) speak a word of
thanks and/or make an appeal rooted in that attribute (“we thank you
for/help us to . . .”); finally, (3) express an aspiration rooted in
God’s character, an outcome that makes sense of the request (“so that
we might . . .”). For example, (1) Lord Jesus, you said that wherever
two or three are gathered together, you are with them. (2) We thank
you, then, for this good food, for those who made it, for each other,
and for your presence with us as we eat. Open our eyes to see you at
this table, (3) so that we might more easily see you when we leave it.</p>

After being persuaded that we need to be more serious about lament in our worship, we have been struggling with where to put it in the service.&nbsp; There seems to be no natural place in our order of service where it &quot;fits.&quot;&nbsp; Then someone at a planning meeting suggested we replace the confession one week with a lament.&nbsp; Not to avoid our own sin, but to recognize that our personal sin is caught up in the brokenness of the whole world.&nbsp; We lament then, and say not so much &quot;I <em>have</em> messed up&quot; but &quot;I <em>am</em> messed up.&quot;&nbsp; </p>

<p>But then there is another difficulty: what is the appropriate response to lament?&nbsp; After a confession, we long to hear words of God's forgiveness:&nbsp; &quot;As far as the east is from the west, so far do I remove your transgressions from you.&quot;&nbsp; This doesn't seem quite right when we're talking about racism and environmental degradation and cancer.&nbsp; </p>

<p>But a declaration of God's ultimate sovereignty is exactly right -- it follows the Biblical pattern (see, for instance, <a href="http://bible.crosswalk.com/OnlineStudyBible/bible.cgi?new=1&amp;word=psalm+42&amp;section=0&amp;version=nrs&amp;language=en">Psalm 42</a> or 43), and it assures us (just as an assurance of pardon) that in the end, all will be well, and all manner of things will be well.<br /><span style="font-size: 0.8em;"><br />(Art courtesy <a href="http://www.davidsweeneyart.com/">www.davidsweeneyart.com</a>)</span></p>

I wonder about two possible locations (of course there could be many places) that might be valuable for the lament.

One place - especially on occasions of evident public sorrow or perplexity (such as after September 11) - might be as part of the gathering of the people.  As we acknowledge God's presence, it could serve as a covenantal recitation similar to spiritual moves in the Bible's book of Lamentations.  We bear our grief before God and recite the promises of God toward us.  It always strikes me as remarkable that the famous verse "God's mercies fall fresh every morning" (what a great smiling welcome to worship) are drawn from the people of destroyed Jerusalem's demand for God to be remain true to covenantal promises.

You might catch that I think an appropriate response to lamentation is remembrance of God's covenantal promises.  A range of covenantal references can be used from both Hebrew and Greek scriptures.

A second placement might be in front of the eucharist.  Again, since the eucharist reflects the new covenant, it would be a powerful response to and companionship with our lament.  If eucharist is absent from the order on a particular day, it could precede a reciting of a covenant verse that leads toward prayers of the people.

Perhaps this can help push the conversation forward.

<p>We wanted to create a dramatic launch to the service (&quot;Here we go!&quot;) without succumbing to the cultural forces that pull us toward making the whole thing an entertaining show (&quot;Ladies and Gentlemen!&#0160; Your attention please!&quot;)</p>
<p>We decided to begin with an appropriate greeting -- in the Lord&#39;s name, if not in the Lord&#39;s voice -- and then remind each other of why we&#39;ve gathered: to worship, to renew the covenant of grace between God and God&#39;s people.&#0160; What we came up with was a short opening song.&#0160; Click <a href="http://worshiphelps.blogs.com/TLBWY.opening.pdf">here</a>&#0160;for the music in lead sheet format.&#0160; And <a href="http://worshiphelps.blogs.com/TLBWY.opening.mp3">here</a> for an Mp3 recording.</p>
<p>It&#39;s free for anyone&#39;s use - but do report that use to CCLI.&#0160;</p>

A bit of advice on using drama in worship, excerpted from a&nbsp; forthcoming <a href="https://www.reformedworship.org/article/december-2001/share-and-share-alike-free-and-nearly-free-drama-resources">publication</a>.</p><blockquote><p>“We need more drama in worship.&nbsp; But drama of the right sort. Not a light-hearted warm-up to the sermon, not a subtlety-deficient morality lesson – a good hard thwack in the ethics –
but something that does what drama does best: provoke and ask questions.&nbsp; We need drama that genuinely invites the congregation into a space where the text and our unique lives
intersect.</p>

<p>“Of course, all congregations use drama in
worship. Scripture read with passion and intelligence is drama. A song
that tells the salvation story is drama. Worship as a whole is drama.
The best worship services, the best liturgies, are those that re-enact
the drama of God and God’s people, traversing the contours of the
covenant life. For that very reason, other “mini” dramas, inserted into
the liturgy, can distract from the primary work of the people. Yet
thoughtful, well-written drama can be used fruitfully in worship: to
point out paradox or hypocrisy, to deepen confession, to give
expression to anguish, to testify to unmerited grace. It can illumine
places where the changeless Gospel intersects with our changing times.
In a world becoming less literate and more oral and aural, drama is a
powerful – and often overlooked – tool for proclaiming that Gospel.</p>

<p>“Still, the wise pastor will make sure that materials used in worship
are reviewed by someone with theological discernment, who knows a good
heresy when she sees one, who knows to avoid moralistic shlock and
propagandistic screeds, who shuns the quick laugh and uninformed
improvisation; someone who knows that part of the power of drama in
worship is its poetic character, the concentrated, careful use of words
– always in service of the One Word.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Last week I finished writing a piece for Fuller Seminary's 3x-yearly magazine of theology &amp; commentary, <a href="https://digitalcommons.fuller.edu/tnn/157/">Theology News &amp; Notes</a>.
This particular issue's theme is the place of music in worship, and I
was asked to contribute a piece on the effect of technology on worship
music. My thesis, simply put, is a truism borrowed from the computer
industry -- hardware drives software:</p><blockquote><p>As the church
seeks to make the most of certain hardware technology – amplification,
lyric projection, and looping DJ software, for example – we can expect
that our worship software, i.e. the style of our worship itself, will
also change. It may expand in potentially wonderful and creatively
enculturated new ways, following the leading of the Holy Spirit. Or it
may be narrowed in ways that are hip, but historically, and even
theologically, suspect.</p></blockquote><p>The article then examines the three aforementioned technologies, pointing out the good and the bad, the helpful and the heinous.</p>

<p>The
idea for the piece arose arose out of a seed of an observation about
hardware and software and the composition of some contemporary worship
songs:</p><blockquote><p>I have begun to see signs that some songs are
being composed, perhaps unconsciously, not just to take advantage of
the technology, but bounded by its peculiar limitations. The structure
of the songs and the shape of the melodies are being molded to fit the
size of the screen and the super-sized words projected onto it. Thus,
we no longer get lyrical lines of melody and text; we get textual
phraselets and melodic motifs -- mere musical fragments, not bearing
repetition, but repeated nevertheless. And repeated. </p></blockquote>

<p>Lest I appear a Luddite here, I hasten to add that in the article I
have many good things to say about amplification, projection, and yes,
DJ looping software. <a href="http://worshiphelps.blogs.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/splashlogo.gif" onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=534,height=190,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false"><img width="150" height="53" border="0" alt="Splashlogo" title="Splashlogo" src="https://worshiphelps.blogs.com/worship_helps/images/splashlogo.gif" style="margin: 5px 10px 10px 5px; float: right;" /></a>But I am concerned that we are less discerning
than we might be. I challenge you, for example, to visit <a href="http://www.tfwm.com/">this</a>
website and find a single theological insight brought to bear on the
use of technology in worship. Sigh. There's a lot of work to be done.</p>

<p>I
am quite interested in hearing from others who read
this blog: what effects on worship style/software do you see as a
result of the church's adoption/adaptation of certain hardware
technologies?&nbsp; Do you have examples of really wonderful and fitting uses of technology?&nbsp; </p>

<p>For example, I have seen pastors use video clips in sermons, sometimes well, sometimes not so much.&nbsp; But the time I really thought a video clip was used well in a service was when the sanctuary went dark just before the congregational prayer, and we saw a 5 minute home-made video that had been taken the week before by the pastor going to visit some of the elderly folks at the nursing home and a couple of shut-ins.&nbsp; These people told little bits of their stories, and said what they wanted prayer for.&nbsp; Some couldn't talk, and then the pastor did a bit of voice-over.&nbsp; It was a powerful introduction to congregational prayer - reminding us again that we are a body of Christ, united with many others, present and not present, as we gather together to pray.</p>

First, some words of introduction. This will serve not only to let you know something about me - Andrew Donaldson -- but also to introduce some of the subject areas that I am passionate about.</p>

<p>
 I am Pastoral Musician and Worship Enlivener (more on that title in a moment) at <a href="http://www.trafalgarchurch.ca/">Trafalgar Presbyterian Church</a> in Oakville, Ontario, Canada. I am currently President of the <a href="http://www.thehymnsociety.org/">Hymn Society in the US and Canada</a>.&nbsp; &nbsp;And along with my wife, I am part of <a href="http://www.andrewdonaldson.ca/hilariter/">Hilariter</a>, an inter-denominational group of singers and players, based in
Toronto, Canada, committed to diversity in worship and to exploring the
worship resources available from around the world.</p>

<p>
I am a lapsed (and recently re-activated) percussionist with a background in choral music, composition and classical guitar. I'm also a student of the renaissance lute.</p>

<p>
An unusual background for a church music director, I'll admit - or at least it was when I began directing church music in the early eighties. At my first congregation, <a href="http://new.beacheschurch.org/">Beaches Presbyterian Church</a> in Toronto, we developed a music program that included &quot;traditional&quot; strophic hymns, world music, and original music written by congregational members, including myself. </p>

<p>
I had learned the global music from Pablo Sosa, Patrick Matsikenyiri and I-to Loh, among others, at a World Council of Churches Worship conference in the middle eighties. To it, we added some contemporary music, chants from <a href="http://www.taize.fr/">Taizé</a>, and songs from the <a href="http://www.iona.org.uk/">Iona Community</a>. </p>

<p>
Over the course of twenty years, we found that this had transformed several key aspects of our worshipping community.&nbsp; First, the liturgy had become richer, more varied. From being a service with four hymns, some prayers and a sermon, it offered many ways for young and old, able and disabled, musical and not-so-musical, - the whole worshipping community - to pray, to praise, to lament, to celebrate as a singing community.</p>

<p>
Second, the role of the choir had become something different. It could still offer a Tallis motet or a Gibbons verse anthem, but it could also lead the congregation in a Zulu church song, or an African American spiritual. It featured instrumentalists as well as singers: flute, violin, cello, concertina, recorders, percussion, guitar, and many others. It had also grown from being a performing choir into a group of music leaders that nurtured the song of the congregation.</p>

<p>
Third, my own role had changed, and for a while we didn't have a name for it. It wasn't until <a href="https://www.choristersguild.org/document//160/">Michael Hawn</a>, from Perkins School of Theology at SMU in Dallas, came to worship with us at Beaches Church in the fall of 2003, that we realized that my role had become that of an “animateur” or an “enlivener”. This is a term proposed by Michael Warren, a Roman Catholic educator, quoted in Dr. Hawn's book “<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/156699277X/sr=8-1/qid=1147747204/ref=pd_bbs_1/103-5407787-3041462?%5Fencoding=UTF8">One Bread, One Body</a>” (Alban Institute 2003).</p>

<p>
When I moved to my current church just outside of Toronto, we decided that this word “enlivener” should be part of my title. We find that it stimulates ongoing discussion on my role in the music and worship of the community.</p>

<p>
I am passionate (in a polite, Canadian sort of way) about nurturing congregational song. I also love exploring ways of bringing scripture to vibrant, dramatic, comforting and disturbing life in worship.&nbsp; We are also discovering that what we have been doing for twenty years has a new title: The Emerging Church.</p>
